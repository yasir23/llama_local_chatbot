DECISION AND ORDER 
- against - 
RICHARD WU, WAI MING HO, SIMON LEE, 
ERIC WONG and XU ME1 ZHOU, 
Defendants. 
Plaintiff in this action seeking to impose a constructive 
trust over funds involved in an alleged fraudulent transfer of real 
property [specifically, a forged deed in the chain of title1 , moves 
f.or leave to renew or reargue a decision on a cross-motion of 
defendants Wong and Zhou which dismissed the compliant against 
them. 
FACTS 
The basis for the motion to renew is a newly discovered 
letter from Margaret Dato, Vice President and Counsel for STG 
Associates, the title company which insured Wong and Zhou, the 
purchasers of the property, to attorney Simon Lee, the attorney 
involved in the closing, a defendant herein, dated October 17, 
1996, in which Dato advised Lee that STG was unable to dispose of 
certain exceptions in the title report because STG could not 
ascertain the name of the title company which insured Lee's clients 
and asked for assistance. 
The facts of this case are set out in the decision/order of 
September 8, 2000, and will not be repeated except as relevant. [* 2 ]
In that decision, the court had noted that Dato "state[dI in her 
affidavit that at no time was she aware of any forgery". In her 
affirmation Dato also stated that she was unaware of "any other 
break in the chain of title. 
DISCUSSION 
The motion to renew is granted, and upon renewal, the court 
adheres to its original decision. As stated in this court's 
decision, Real Property Law §266 and Emerson Hills Realty, Inc. v 
Mirabella (220 AD2d 717 [2nd Dept. 19951 ) protects a purchaser for 
value of real property where there is no evidence of knowledge of 
prior fraud on the on the part of the vendor. Kearns v 
Manufacturers Hanover Trust (51 Misc. 2d 34 [Sup. Ct. Suffolk Co. 
1960]), cited by the plaintiff for the proposition that a forged 
deed cannot convey good title is distinguishable from the instant 
situation in that the Kearns grantees had knowledge of the forgery. 
Here, the recently unearthed letter indicates that STG had 
questions and investigated those questions. Since STG ultimately 
insured the title, it is reasonable to assume that the questions 
were resolved prior to closing. Further, it is quite a stretch to 
bootstrap Dato's diligent title investigation into the conclusion 
that Dato an/or the purchasers therefore "knew or should have known 
of the sellers' alleged prior fraud" (see, Emerson Hills Realty, 
Inc. v Mirabella, supra). Further, even 
evidence of a gratuitous transfer in the chain of title 
does not, without knowledge of fraud, render a conveyance 
fraudulent and voidable as against a purchaser or 
mortgagee for value (see, Real Property Law 5 266; Debtor 
2 [* 3 ]
and Creditor Law § 278; Anderson v. Blood, 152 N.Y. 285, 
rearg denied 153 N.Y. 649, Stearns v. Gage, 79 N.Y. 
102). 
(See, Miner v Edwards, 221 AD2d 934 [4th Dept. 19951) 
Finally, plaintiff’s speculative arguments in his reply 
affirmention regarding possible collusion on the part of Wong and 
Zhou, are simply unsubstantiated by even a scintilla of proof. That 
Ho, the former wife of defendant Richard Win, who took title to the 
property allegedly as part of a settlement in a matrimonial 
action, cannot be located does not implicate Wong and Zhou as 
perpatrators of a fraud upon plaintiff. 
Accordingly, upon renewal the court declines to vacate its 
prior decision/order dismissing the complaint against Wong and 
Zhou. 
This constitutes the decision and order of the court. h
