Third-party defendant seeks summary judgment. Defendant, TEMCO 
BUILDING MAINTENANCE, INC. also seeks summary judgment dismissing the 
plaintiff‘s complaint and all cross-claims as against this defendant 
pursuant to CPLR 53212. Defendant, CITIBANK, N.A., seeks summary judgment 
pursuant to CPLR 53212 for a conditional judgment as against 
defendant/third-party plaintiff, TEMCO BUILDING MAINTENANCE, INC. 
Plaintiff commenced this action for injuries sustained when he slipped 
and fell on ice on a sidewalk that surrounds the CITIBANK building. 
Defendant, TEMCO BUILDING MAINTENANCE, INC. (TEMCO) had a written agreement 
with CITIBANK to provide services which included interior cleaning and snow 
removal. TEMCO and third-party defendant, LONG ISLAND SNOW REMOVAL, (LISR) 
had an oral agreement by which LISR would perform snow removal and salting 
at CITIBANK branches, including the branch in question. 
These motions for summary judgment are based on the deposition 
testimony of Stephen Taylor, who testified on behalf of TEMCO as its 
General Manager and William Grosso, who testified on behalf of LISR as a 
principal of LISR. 
removal after getting a call from Stephen Taylor indicating the work that 
needed to be done. LISR argues that it did not owe duty to plaintiff or 
TEMCO and that there has been no showing that LISR was negligent, 
warranting summary judgment. TEMCO and LISR agreed that LISR would perform snow 
The incident involving plaintiff’s fall occurred on January 11, 1994. 
According to its invoices, LISR performed snow removal on January 7th and 
8th and then did some additional salting on January 7th and gth of that year. 
Counsel for LISR also argues that there has been no proof as to the origin 
of the ice upon which plaintiff fell. 
The agreement between CITIBANK and TEMCO was to automatically plow 
parking lots when there was snowfall of two (2)inches or above. If there 
were’less than two inches of snowfall, it was at CITIBANK’s discretion to 
contact TEMCO for snow removal services. TEMCO also argues that it owed no 
duty to the plaintiff by virtue of the contract with CITIBANK. Counsel for 
TEMCO maintains that there was no intention on the part of the parties to 
displace entirely the property owner’s duty to maintain the property and 
place it in the sole responsibility of the contractors, citing Palka v 
Servicemaster Management Services Corp., 83 NY2d 579, 611 NYS2D 817 (1994). 
Counsel also submits that TEMCO is entitled to common law indemnification 
from LISR because LISR provided all the snow removal work. [* 2]

Counsel for CITIBANK states that the agreement between CITIBANK and 
TEMCO clearly provides that the contractor will be responsible for the 
removal of snow from sidewalks and walkways adjoining the bank. Said 
contract further provides that the contractor "will apply sand and/or ice 
melt in sufficient quantities so as to alleviate any hazardous icy 
conditions". It is only snow plowing of the parking lots that is triggered 
by the two (2) inch standard. Counsel therefore argues that the agreement 
is comprehensive and exclusive with respect to snow and ice removal from 
the walkways. There is also an indemnity provision in the contract. 
Summary judgment is a drastic remedy which should not be granted if 
there is any doubt as to the existence of a triable issue. 
Denckla, 182 AD2d 658, 582 NYS2d 252 (2nd Dept., 1992)) It is well-settled 
that the movant has the burden of proof to demonstrate the absence of any 
material issues of fact. (Tessier v New York City Health and Hospitals 
Corporation, 177 AD2d 626, 576 NYS2d 331 (2nd Dept., 1991)) Thereafter, 
the opposing party must produce evidentiary proof, in admissible form, 
which demonstrates that a trial is required because of material questions 
of fact. (Taylor-Warner Corp. v Minskoff, 167 AD2d 382, 561 NYS2d 797 (2nd 
Dept. , 1990) ) (Barclay v 
The agreement between TEMCO and CITIBANK is clear on its face. 
CITIBANK is contractually entitled to a conditional judgment over against 
TEMCO for any judgment which may be rendered against CITIBANK as the result 
of the plaintiff's claim based upon the duties to be performed by TEMCO 
pursuant to its written contract with CITIBANK onlv in the event it is found that CITIBANK was not solely negligent. The Court does find that 
such an agreement would be unenforceable if it were shown that CITIBANK was 
negligent in part. 
Brooklyn Union Gas Co., 168 AD2d 477, 562 NYS2d 718 (2nd Dept. 1990)), 
appealed denied 78 NY2d 864, 578 NYS2d 879 (1991) (see, General Obligations Law S.5-322.1; Connolly v 
Counsel for TEMCO argues that summary judgment is not warranted on 
contractual indemnity or common law indemnity in favor of CITIBANK because 
there is an issue as to any negligence by CITIBANK. According to the 
testimony of Ms. Judy Roberts, CITIBANK's Assistant Manager, the manager 
would look and inspect the exterior of the branch for snuw and ice when the 
branch opened. 
entire deposition transcript of Ms. Roberts. At this juncture, the Court 
finds that defendant/CITIBANK has not made a prima facie showing of 
entitlement to summary judgment. Counsel for CITIBANK merely states that 
there is no evidence of negligence on the part of this defendant; 
absent the full transcript of Ms. Roberts and any information as to what 
the manager would do in the event of noticing ice on the premises, 
judgment is precluded. The Court notes that it has not been provided with the 
however, 
summary 
The Court finds that third-party defendant, LISR, has not made out a 
prima facie showing of entitlement to summary judgment on the issue of 
negligence. The deposition testimony of Mr. Grosso was extremely vague. 
Mr. Grosso does not know if he used subcontractors for removal at the 
CITIBANK location. He had no documents regarding snow removal at the 
premises except billing records. The billing records do not provide much 
information either as Mr. Grosso testified that sometimes the bills would [* 3]

be dated the date of the storm itself but sometimes they could be dated a 
day or two later (see, deposition transcript of Mr. Grosso at pages 20-23). 
As such, the motion of LISR for summary judgment on its third-party 
complaint is denied. The Court finds that there is an issue of common law 
indemnification as to any negligence by LISR. The Court does dismiss the 
causes of action asserted by TEMCO for contractual indemnification and 
failure to procure insurance, there being no opposition thereto. 
TEMCO's motion and LISR's motion for summary judgment against 
plaintiff are granted. 
while he was walking very slowly and carefully on an area that was icy all 
over (see, plaintiff's deposition transcript at page "8"). The Court does 
find, however, that TEMCO and LISR owed no duty to the plaintiff by virtue 
of the snow removal contract with defendant CITIBANK and the agreement with 
TEMCO as it never shifted in its entirety its duty as a property owner to 
maintain the premises to these two defendants. (see, Palka v Servicemaster 
Management Services Corp., supra; Arnhold v Pyramid Management Group, Inc., 
260 AD2d 518, 688 NYS2d 251 (2nd Dept., 1999)). Accordingly, TEMCO and 
LISR are entitled to summary judgment as against plaintiff. Based on the 
foregoing plaintiff's complaint as against TEMCO BUILDING MAINTENANCE, INC. 
and any claims by plaintiff as against LISR, are hereby dismissed. The testimony of the plaintiff was that he fell 
TEMCO is not granted summary judgment on its common law 
indemnification claim in the third-party action because no determination 
has been made as to any negligence by LISR. 
The foregoing constitutes the ORDER of this Court.
