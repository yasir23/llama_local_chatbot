MEMORANDUM AND JUDGMENT 
By petition pursuant to Article 78 of the CPLR verified on March 9, 2007, 
Fletcher Rumph seeks review of a parole release hearing conducted on March 15, 2006. 
Petitioner appeared with counsel assigned by an order to show cause dated March 13,2007 
and contended that he should be granted a de novo hearing. Respondent requests that the 
petition be denied upon the answer dated April 20, 2007 and the record of confidential 
information submitted to the Court. 
The petition is without merit. The Board of Parole could cite the petitioner’s 
criminal history, including the violent conduct underlying his latest conviction for robbery, [* 1 ]
Memorandum and Judgment -2- Index No. 20,437-07 
as sufficient grounds for denying release (see Matter of Fuchino v. Herbert, 255 A.D.2d 914 
[1998]; Matter of Scott v. Russi, 208 A.D.2d 931 [1994]; Matter of Putland v. Herbert, 231 
A.D.2d 893 [1996], motion for leave to appeal denied 89 N.Y.2d 806; People ex re1 Justice 
v. Russi, 226 A.D.2d 821 [1996]; Matter of Fortune v. Russi, Supreme Court of Wyoming 
County, Index No. 17,207, Memorandum and Judgment dated July 22, 1994, annexed, 
affirmed 219 A.D.2d 869 [1995]). The commissioners had discretion to place greater weight 
on these factors than they placed on his program performance, institutional adjustment and 
proposed release plans (see Matter of Ristau v. Hammock, 103 A.D.2d 944 [1984], motion 
for leave to appeal denied 63 N.Y.2d 608; Matter of Rentz v. Herbert, 206 A.D.2d 944 
[1994], motion for leave to appeal denied 84 N.Y.2d 810). Furthermore, their decision did 
not have to specifically mention every factor weighed in reaching a determination (see 
Matter of Mackall v. New York State Board of Parole, 91 A.D.2d 1023 [1983], motion for 
leave to appeal denied 58 N.Y.2d 609; Matter of Davis v. New York State Division of Parole, 
114 A.D.2d 412 [1985]). Petitioner has not demonstrated that the commissioners failed to 
give fair consideration to all of the relevant statutory factors pursuant to Executive Law 
§259-i(2)(c) (see Matter of Zane v. Travis, 231 A.D.2d 848 [1996]; People ex re1 Thomas 
v. Superintendent of Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, 124 A.D.2d 848 [1986], leave denied 
69 N.Y.2d 611). Thus, judicial intervention is precluded in this matter because the petitioner 
has failed to establish that the respondent's decision was made in violation of the law or not 
supported by the record and tainted by "irrationality bordering on impropriety" (see Matter 
of Russo v. New York State Division of Parole, 50 N.Y.2d 69, 77 [1980]; Matter of Despard 
v. Russi, 192 A.D.2d 1076 [1993], motion for leave to appeal denied 82 N.Y.2d 652). 
Upon review of the entire record, the Court further finds that the petitioner is 
not entitled to relief upon his claim that this disposition was "excessiven (see Matter of Pel1 
v. Board of Education, 34 N.Y.2d 222,233 [1974]; Matter of Madlock v. Russi, 195 A.D.2d 
646 [1993]). 
NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby 
ORDERED that the petition is denied.

By petition pursuant to Article 78 of the CPLR verified 
on May 20, 1994, Anthony Fortune seeks review of a parole release 
hearing conducted on October 28, 1993. Petitioner appeared with 
counsel assigned by an order to show cause dated May 25, 1994 and 
contended that he should be granted a de novo hearing. Respondents 
request that relief be denied upon the answer dated June 27, 1994 
and the record of confidential information submitted to the Court. [* 3 ]
Memorandum and Judgment -2- Index No. 17,207 
The Board of Parole issued the following statement upon 
considering the petitioner's suitability for parole release: 
''fplarole is again denied due to the extreme gravity of your 
controlling conviction for Murder 2O, wherein during the course of 
an in concert robbery, you shot the owner of a butcher shop in the 
head". Petitioner's counsel primarily argues that this statement 
was a "simple generalizationN and insufficient to justify the 
denial of release because the Board failed to specify why this 
particular crime should preclude release. 
Petitioner relies upon a recent decision by the Appellate 
Division for the First Department in challenging the adequacy of 
the Board's decision. In Matter of Kinq v. New York State Division 
of Parole (190 A.D.2d 423 [1993]), the Appellate Division affirmed 
a Supreme Court order annulling a Parole Board decision to deny 
release based upon the serious nature of an inmate's felony murder 
conviction for the killing of an off-duty police officer. Much of 
the opinion was concerned with inappropriate comments of a 
commissioner at the hearing which, according to the Appellate 
Division, showed that "the decision of the Parole Board was based 
upon a fundamental misunderstanding of its role and its power.. . If 
(p. 430). These remarks were interpreted as showing that the Board 
had failed to properly consider relevant statutory standards and 
had instead proceeded Ifon the assumption that its primary duty was 
to determine, in the abstract, the appropriate penalty for murder 
in today's society" (pp. 431-432). 
The Appellate Division also criticized the manner in 
which the Parole Board had applied one of the factors relevant to 
its decision: the seriousness of the inmate's crime. The Court 
noted that the legislature Ifhas not defined 'seriousness of [the] 
crime' in terms of specific categories of either crimes or victims 
and it is apparent that in order to preclude the granting of parole 
exclusively on this ground there must have been some significantly 
aggravating or egregious circumstances surrounding the commission 
of the particular crime (citation omitted). Certainly every murder [* 4 ]
Memorandum and Judgment -3- 
conviction is inherently a matter of the utmost seriousness since 
it reflects the unjustifiable taking and tragic loss of a human 
life. Since, however, the Legislature has determined that a murder 
conviction per se should not preclude parole, there must be a 
showing of some aggravating circumstances beyond the inherent 
seriousness of the crime itself" (p. 433). The Appellate Division 
further criticized the Board for failing "to examine the evidence 
at trial" and only taking into account the death of the police 
officer to evaluate the severity of the criminal conduct (p. 433). 
Petitioner's counsel relies upon this holding to support his 
contention that the instant decision of the Board failed to specify 
why the petitioner's crime was so serious as to preclude release. 
The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the Appellate 
Division's order which remanded the case to the Board for a de novo 
hearing (see Matter of Kins v. New York State Division of Parole, 
83 N.Y.2d 788 [1994]). The Court of Appeals, however, did not do so 
on the Appellate Division's decision. The Court of Appeals issued 
its own opinion which focused upon the commissioner's inappropriate 
comments on the record. The Court concluded that the record 
included evidence "that petitioner was not afforded a proper 
hearing because one of the Commissioners considered factors outside 
the scope of the applicable statute, including penal philosophy, 
the historical treatment of individuals convicted of murder, the 
death penalty, life imprisonment without parole, and the 
consequences to society if those sentences are not in place. 
Consideration of such factors is not authorized by Executive Law 
§259-irr (p. 791). The Court expressed no opinion as to how the 
seriousness of an offense is to be determined but merely noted that 
it was a mandatory factor for consideration under the statute (p. 
790). 
It thus appears that the New York Court of Appeals did 
not adopt the First Department's condemnation of the manner in 
which the Board of Parole evaluated the serious nature of an 
offense. This Court, therefore, would not be bound by the First [* 5 ]
d 
Memorandum and Judgment -4- Index No. 17,207 
Department's decision if there is contrary appellate authority in 
another Department. 
The Court is of the opinion that the First Department's 
opinion in Matter of Kinq v. New York State Division of Parole 
(supra) is inconsistent with the decisions in the Fourth Department 
and other appellate decisions which have interpreted the Board's 
authority to deny release under the Executive Law and the prior 
similar statutory authority under the Correction Law. These 
decisions have approved the denial of release based upon a similar 
reference to the serious nature of the type of crime at issue (see 
Matter of Watkins v. Caldwell, 54 A.D.2d 42 [1976], motion for 
leave to appeal dismissed 40 N.Y.2d 986; Matter of Gonzasue v. New 
York State Board of Parole, 58 A.D.2d 707 [19771; Matter of Ristau 
v. Hammock, 103 A.D.2d 944 [1984], motion for leave to appeal 
denied 63 N.Y.2d 608; Matter of Fusco v. Chairman, Board of Parole 
of the State of New York, 59 A.D.2d 973 [19771, leave denied 43 
N.Y.2d 648; Matter of Ittiq v. New York Board of Parole, 59 A.D.2d 
972 [1977], leave denied 43 N.Y.2d 648; Matter of Rentz v. Herbert, - A.D.2d -, decision filed by the Appellate Division for the 
Fourth Department dated July 15, 1994). 
Petitioner admitted before the Board of Parole that his 
criminal conduct had been Ifextremely serious" (transcript, p. 5). 
The Board had discretion to place primary reliance upon this factor 
and attach less sigxificance to his perfornance in institutional 
programs (see Matter of Ristau v. Hammock, 103 A.D.2d 944 [19841, 
motion for leave to appeal denied 63 N.Y.2d 608; Matter of Orliz 
v. Hammock, 96 A.D.2d 735 [1983]; Matter of Sinowoli v. New York 
State Board of Parole, 189 A.D.2d 960 [1993]; Matter of Walker v. 
Russi, 176 A.D.2d 1185 [1991], appeal dismissed 79 N.Y.2d 897; 
Matter of Salcedo v. Ross, 183 A.D.2d 771 [1992]). Thus, judicial 
intervention is precluded in this matter because the petitioner has 
failed to establish that the respondents' decision was made in 
violation of the law or not supported by the record and tainted by 
Ifirrationality bordering on impropriety" (see Matter of Desward v. [* 6 ]
Memorandum and Judgment -5- Index No. 17,207 
Russi, 192 A.D.2d 1076 f19931, motion for leave to appeal denied 82 
N.Y.2d 652). 
Upon review of the entire record, the Court further finds 
that the petitioner is not entitled to relief upon his claim that 
the disposition was "excessiven (see Matter of Pel1 v. Board of 
Education, 34 N.Y.2d 222, 233 [1974]; Matter of Madlock v. Russi, 
195 A.D.2d 646 [19931). 
NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby 
ORDERED that the petition is denied.
