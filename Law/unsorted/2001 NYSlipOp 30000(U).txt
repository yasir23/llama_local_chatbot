The Court in its deliberations herein has considered: 
1. Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment and supporting papers including 
2. Notice of Cross-Motion and supporting papers; 
3. Affirmation in Opposition and in support by Defendant, C & D UNLIMITED 
4. Affirmation in Opposition by Defendant, DON ANTORINO SEWER & DRAIN, INC.; 
5. Affidavit in Opposition by Plaintiff; 
6. Reply Affirmation. Memorandum of Law; 
INC. , ; 
Defendant, C&D UNLIMITED, INC., moves for summary judgment based on Labor Law SS200 
and 241 (6) and on common law negligence grounds. Plaintiff cross-moves for summary 
judgment on liability pursuant to Labor Law 5241 (6). 
By Order of this Court, plaintiffs’ claims under Labor Law 240 (1) against defendant 
C & D UNLIMITED, INC., were dismissed. This defendant now claims that summary judgment is 
warranted on all other claims. The Court notes that there is only one defendant left in 
this action, namely C & D UNLIMITED, INC.. 
Summary judgment is a drastic remedy which should not be granted if there is any 
doubt as to the existence of a triable issue. (Barclay v Denckla, 182 AD2d 658, 582 NYS2d 
252 (2nd Dept., 1992)) It is well-settled that the movant has the burden of proof to 
demonstrate the absence of any material issues of fact. (Tessier v New York City Health . 
and Hospitals Corporation, 177 AD2d 626, 576 NYS2d 331 (2nd Dept., 1991)) Thereafter, the 
opposing party must produce evidentiary proof, in admissible form, which demonstrates that 
a trial is required because of material questions of fact, (Taylor-Warner Corp. v Minskoff, 
167 AD2d 382, 561 NYS2d 797 (2nd Dept. , 1991)) 
The Court hereby grants the motion of defendant, C & D UNLIMITED, INC., for summary 
judgment on the Labor Law 5200 and common law negligence claims asserted by plaintiffs. 
In this Court’s Order dated February 12, 2000 which is the law of the case, the Court 
found that it was the injured plaintiff who was hired in a supervisory capacity to make 
sure that the defendant, ANTORINO SEWER E, DRAIN, INC., was doing the job properly. Moving 
defendant correctly points out that it never exercised any supervision or control over the [* 1 ]
Ferforlnance of the work at the time of the plaintiff's injury. This defendant having 
shown entitlement to summary judgment, it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to show a 
triable issue of fact, which they have not done. At no time do the plaintiffs oppose this 
defendant's motion as it relates to Labor Law S200 and common law negligence claims. 
Accordingly, the Court hereby dismisses plaintiffs' causes of action as against C & D 
UNLIMITED, INC. based on Labor Law 5200 and common law negligence. 
The Court now considers the plaintiffs request and the request of C & D UNLIMITED, 
INC. for summary judgment based on Labor Law S241 (6). This defendant argues that Labor 
Law S241 (6) is inapplicable to the present case because the plaintiffs must establish a 
violation of a specific safety violation promulgated by the Commissioner of the Department 
of Labor, which they have failed to do. Defendant claims that the alleged violation of 
-:he Industrial Code, namely $23-1.5, § 23-1.33, S23-4.4 and S23-4.5 do not apply to the 
instant facts. 
The injured plaintiff was working at an excavation and construction site. At the 
time, drainage pools were being installed, requiring the creation of a large hole. Mr. 
EDWARDS was measuring the depth of the hole when the grassy area gave way, causing him to 
fall approximately forty (40) feet to the bottom of the hole. Plaintiffs explain that the 
sides of the holes were not shored in any manner and that it was not equipped with any 
safety line to prevent his fall. Counsel for plaintiffs alleges that this defendant 
violated the Industrial Code 12 NYCRR S23-1.7(b) (1) and 23-4.2(a) and (h) . The Court 
r,ctes that plaintiffs do not argue that Industrial Code SS23-1.33 23-4.4 and 23-4.5 are 
applicable to this case. 
In this case, the Court finds that this defendant has failed to meet its burden 
demonstrating that summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs' claim under Labor Law S241 (6) 
is warranted. Defendant merely surmises that plaintiffs have failed to show a violation 
of the Industrial Code, without any further explanation. This defendant states that 
plaintiff was not doing excavation work; however, 
a person working at or frequenting an excavation and mandates protection. Industrial Code S23-4.2 is applicable to 
Defendant also argues that INDUSTRIAL CODE §23-1.7(b)(l) requires hazardous openings 
to be guarded but defendant's counsel opines that because the digging in this case was 
ongoing and a work in progress, that section of the Industrial Code is "inapplicable to 
tnis case that no safety cover or railing could be constructed and installed and still 
enable ANTORINO to dig the hole". This is pure conjecture on the part of defendant's 
counsel. Defendant also claims that for the same reason, any violation of Industrial Code 
523-4.2 is also inapplicable to these facts because "sheeting and shoring cannot be 
installed at a work site that is constantly evolving because of the work in progress". 
Again, this is counsel's opinion and as such, the Court denies this defendant's motion for 
summary judgment on the Labor Law S241(6) cause of action. 
Labor law §241(6) is not a strict liability statute and once it is alleged that a 
violation of 'the Code has taken place, it is for the jury to decide whether the negligence 
of some parties has caused injury to plaintiff. (see, Rizzuto v L.A. Wenger Constr. CO., 
91 NY2d 343, 670 NYS2d 816 (1998)) Plaintiff has provided the affidavit of a safety 
consultant who opines that "the sides of the hole should have been shored, guarded or 
otherwise supported to prevent the earth from giving way". The Court does find that 
Industrial Code 12 NYCRR §§23-1.7(b) (1) and 23-4.2(a)and (b) do apply to the instant 
facts. Nevertheless, because Labor Law §241(6) is not a strict liability statute, the 
Court must evaluate whether plaintiffs have demonstrated the absence of a triable issue of 
fact on said claim, specifically whether the violation was the proximate cause of the 
injury. A violation of the Industrial Code only constitutes "some evidence of negligence", . 
for which this defendant may be held liable (see, Lorefice v Rekson Operating Partnership, 
L.P. , 269 AD2d 572, 703 NYS2d 507, (2nd Dept., 2000)) 
Most of the affidavit of plaintiffs' expert, Howard I. Edelson, is devoted to the 
failure to equip the injured plaintiff with any protective devices so as to prevent his 
fall. The safety consultant, however, also states that the hole should have been shored. 
It is then incumbent upon defendant to show some triable issue of fact, such as any 
negligence on the part of the injured plaintiff or an inability to shore up the opening, 
which was not done. There are no allegations of contributory negligence on the part of the 
injured plaintiff. No expert's affidavit was submitted by this defendant, counsel merely 
providing conclusory statements that sheeting and shoring could not be installed because [* 2 ]
the work 
judgment site was constantly evolving. 
on the claim pursuant to Labor Based on same, plaintiffs' motion 
Law 5241(6) is hereby granted. 
DATE : The foregoing constitutes the ORDER of this Court.
