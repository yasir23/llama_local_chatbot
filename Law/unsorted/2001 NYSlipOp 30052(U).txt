THE NEW YORK CITY TAXI AND LIMOUSINE 
COMMISSION, 
PRESENT: EILEEN BRANSTEN, J. 
Petitioner, Ahmed Ali (“Ali”), seeks an order annulling the determination of 
respondent the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (the “TLC”) revoking Ali’s 
hack operator license (the “license”), and reinstating the license. 
On February 11, 2000, Ali received two summonses pursuant to TLC’s Taxicab 
Drivers Rules, 35 Rules of the City of New York (“RCNY”) 2-61 (a) (2) and 2-50 (b), for 
failing to stop for Edward Williams (“Williams”), an African -American undercover TLC 
inspector. See, Petition, Exh. B. Section 2-50 (b) prohibits taxi drivers from refusing to 
pick up passengers (a “refusal”) “without justifiable grounds,’’ see 35 RCNY 2-50 (b), 2-50 
(e), and section 2-61 (a) (2) precludes “willful act[s] of omission or commission [by taxi 
drivers] which [are] against the best interests of the public.” See 35 RCNY 2-61 (a) (2). 
Ali’s charges were subsequently amended to include violations for driving off with 
an open taxi door while the passenger was holding on to the door in violation of Vehicle and [* 2 ]

Comm issio n Index No. 107490/0 1 
Page 2 
Traffic Law tj 1 162 pursuant to 35 RCNY 2-2 1 (b) (2); abuse of a passenger pursuant to 35 
RCNY 2-60 (a) because of the section 2-21 (b) (2) violation; and use or attempted use of 
physical force against a passenger pursuant to 35 RCNY 2-60 (b), also because of the 
section 2-21 (b) (2) violation. See, Verified Answer, Exh. B. The notice of amended 
charges also informed Ali that the TLC would seek discretionary revocation of his license 
pursuant to 35 RCNY 8-14.’ 
A TLC administrative law judge (the “ALJ”) held a hearing on the charges against 
Ali on March 3, 2000. The ALJ found Williams’ recitation of the facts “credible and 
persuasive.” See, id., Exh. D. Williams testified that he was standing on Second Avenue 
and 1 
3‘h Street with another inspector when he stretched his hand and arm out to hail 
Ah’s 
taxi as it traveled west on 13* Street. At the time, the taxi’s “For Hire” light was 
illuminated. Williams testified that he made “eye contact” with Ali as the car stopped for 
the red light. When Williams approached the car and opened the rear door, the light 
changed to green and Ali drove off with the door open. As Williams watched, Ali drove to 
1 
2th Street with the door still ajar where he stopped for a red light. Williams and his partner 
’ The TLC may seek revocation of a license for a TLC violation in discretionary 
revocation proceedings on the recommendation of an administrative law judge, even if 
the penalty for violation of the rule is not license revocation. See, 3 5 RCNY 8- 14(a). [* 3 ]

then approached Ali, identified themselves as TLC inspectors and issued two summonses. 
See, id. 
Ali stated in his defense that by the time he saw Williams, the light was already green; 
that he thought Williams’ signal meant that he wished to cross the street against the light, 
even though he had never seen a pedestrian do that; that he only slowed at the light as he 
turned from 
 13‘h Street onto Second Avenue; that the car was moving as Williams opened 
the door; that he thought that Williams was angry and would assault him for not being 
allowed to cross against the light; and that he could not stop anyway because he had to meet 
his medallion owner at 6:30 p.m. See, id. 
Upon the ALJ’s recommendation, the TLC Chairperson found Ali guilty of the 2-50 
(b), 2-2 1 (b) (2) and 2-6 1 (a) (2) violations, and dismissed the other charges. See, Petition, 
Exh. C. As a result of the guilty findings, Ali was fined a total of $500.00 for the 2-50 (b) 
and 2-2 1 (b) (2) violations, and his license revoked for the 2-6 1 (a) (2) violation. See, id. 
On appeal, an Executive Session of the TLC Commissioners (“the Commissioners”) 
affirmed the Chairperson’s decision without modification. See, id., Exhs. G & H. 
Ali then brought this petition, asserting that the revocation of his license was 
arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, contrary to the law and unsupported by substantial 
evidence. See, Petition, 
 7 22. Ali contends that he should not have been charged with 35 
RCNY 
 5 2-61 (a) (2) for his first refusal; that the ALJ’s finding of a 35 RCNY 
 5 2-61 (a) [* 4 ]
Ahmed Ali v. The New York City Taxi & Limousine 
Commission Index No. 107490/0 1 
Page 4 
(2) violation was unsupported by the evidence; and that he has suffered $20,000.00 in 
damages as a result of his license revocation. 
Discussion 
Ali challenges revocation of his license on two grounds: that he should not haye been 
charged with violations of both 35 RCNY 2-50 (b) and 2-61 (a) (2); and that the ALJ’s 
recommendation, adopted by the TLC, was not supported by the record. 
The question of whether the TLC’s determination was supported by substantial 
evidence must be transferred to the Appellate Division because it resulted from a hearing 
held pursuant to law at which evidence was taken. See, CPLR 7804 (g). However, 
 Ah’s 
claim that he should not have been charged with violations of both 35 RCNY 2-50 (b) and 
2-6 1 (a) (2), if sustained could “terminate the proceeding,” thus this Court must resolve that 
issue. See, id. 
It is well settled that the TLC may establish standards for passenger safety and 
service. See, N.Y.C. Charter 
 55 2300,2303 (b); N.Y.C. Admin. Code 
5 19-503; N.Y.C. 
Comm. for Taxi Safety v. N. Y.C. Taxi &Limousine Comm ’n., 177 Misc.2d 855, 861 (N.Y. 
Co.. 1998), aff’d, 256 A.D.2d 136 (1” Dept. 1998). Courts will accord the TLC a high 
degree of deference in the exercise of its rule-making authority, “especially when the [TLC] 
acts in the area of its particular expertise.” See, Consolation Nursing Home, Inc. v. N. Y.S. 
Health Facilities Ass ’n, Inc., 85 N.Y.2d 326,33 1 (1995); United Car & Limousine Found., 
Inc. v. N. Y.C. Taxi& Limousine 
 Comm’n., 178 Misc.2d 734,737 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co., 1998). [* 5 ]

Commission Index No. 107490/0 1

Here, Ali asserts that the 2-61 (a) (2) charge is duplicative of the 2-50 (b) charge. 
However, the TLC clearly has the authority to charge Ali with a 2-6 1 (a) (2) violation. The 
New York City Administrative Code (the “N.Y.C. Admin. Code”) provides that the TLC 
may seek license revocation “for good cause shown relating to a threat to the public health 
or safety . . . .” See, N.Y.C. Admin. Code 
 § 19-5 12.1. 
Additionally, although 3 5 RCNY 2-87 prescribes penalties for 2-50 (b) violations 
depending on the number of violations within a three year period, section 2-87 explicitly 
does not “limit or restrict” the TLC from exercising any other authority it may have to 
revoke a license. See, 35 RCNY 2-87 (a) (1). Thus, the TLC may also charge Ali with a 2- 
6 1 (a) (2) violation and institute discretionary revocation proceedings even if the violated 
rule does not mandate license revocation. See, 35 RCNY 8-14 (a), (g). 
Further, the 2-61 (a) (2) violation may be justified on grounds independent of the 
refusal. First, driving away with an open taxi door is a different type of misconduct from 
a refusal. Next, the violation may be based on any “willful act of omission or commission 
. . . against the best interests of the public,” without limitation, including acts not specifically 
mentioned in the rules. See, 35 RCNY 2-61 (a) (2). 
Thus, section 2-61 (a) (2) may be interpreted to preclude acts “plainly within the 
ambit of [2-6 1 (a) (2)].” See, Fernandez v. N. Y. C. Taxi & Limousine Comm ’n., 193 A.D.2d 
423 (1” Dept. 1993). Ali undisputedly threatened Williams’ and the public’s health and 
safety by driving for at least a block with an open taxi door. A “person of ordinary [* 6 ]
Ahmed Ali v. The New York City Taxi & Limousine 
Commission Index No. 107490/0 1 
Page 6 
intelligence” would agree that it is against the public interest for taxicab drivers to drive with 
open doors. See, Fernandez v. N. Y.C. Taxi & Limousine Comm ’n., 193 A.D.2d 423. For 
all the foregoing reasons, the TLC has the authority to charge Ali with the 2-61 (a) (2) 
violation and revoke his license. 
In view of the foregoing, it is 
ORDERED that the petitioner’s application to annul the respondents’ determination 
to revoke his hack operator license and to reinstate the license on the ground that he was 
denied due process and wrongfully charged with two offenses is denied; and it is further 
ORDERED that petitioner’s application to annul the respondents’ determination to 
revoke his hack operator license and to reinstate the license on the ground that the 
Commission’s determination is not supported by substantial evidence is respectfully 
transferred to the Supreme Court, 
 AppeIlate Division, First Department for disposition 
pursuant to CPLR 
 7804(g). 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to transfer the file to the Appellate Division, First 
Department, upon petitioner’s service upon the Clerk of a copy of this order with notice of 
entry. 
This constitutes the decision and order of the Court.
