ORDERED that the motion by petitioner, William Kollmer Contracting, Ltd., for leave to 
renew and reargue the Order of this court, dated April 25,2001, which dismissed petitioner’s Article 
78 proceeding, without prejudice to the 
commencement of a declaratory judgment action joining 
necessary parties, is granted as follows, and it is fixther 
ORDERED that upon reconsideration leave to join Madeline Hogan as an additional 
petitioner is granted, thereby 
 conferring jurisdiction over all indispensable parties, and it is further 
ORDERED that the petition is converted to a plenary action seeking a declaratory judgment 
and is determined as set forth herein. [* 1]
Kollmer v Town of Huntington 
Index No. 00 -30862 
Page No. 2 
The underlying Article 78 proceeding sought a judgment to annul and void Local Law No. 
29, enacted by the Huntington Town Board and dated October 10,2000, as unconstitutional, illegal 
and ultra vires. Petitioner is the contract vendee of a 24 acre subdivision located with the area 
rezoned.. This Court's prior determination acknowledged that a declaratory judgment action, not 
an Article 78 proceeding was the proper vehicle to challenge legislative acts of a governmental 
entity (see, Bryant Ave. Tenants' Assn. v Koch, 71 NY2d 856,527 NYS2d 743 [1988]; Merrick 
Park Home Owners Assoc. v Hempstead, 143 NY2d 636 [Sup Ct Nassau Co 19551) and also found 
that the Court was unable to convert the action, pursuant to CPLR 103 (c), because it did not have 
jurisdiction over all the necessary parties. Specifically the petitioner had not joined the property 
owner of the subject property or the other two property owners whose property was also rezoned. 
Because the three property owner's rights "might be inequitably affected by a judgment in [this] 
action " they were deemed necessary parties (see, CPLR 1001(a); Wood v City of Salamanca, 289 
NY 279; Sloane v Weber, 42 AD2d 1036,384 NYS2d 614 
[4th Dept 19731; Matter of J-TAssoc. 
v Hudson River-Black River Regulating Dist., 175 AD2d 438, 572 NYS2d 122 [3d Dept 19931). 
In support of the instant motion petitioner has submitted an affidavit of the property owner, 
Madeline Hogan, in which she avers that her interests are the same as that of the petitioner, is bound 
by the court's decision, and asks to join the proceeding as an additional petitioner, or leave to 
intervene. The court deems the affidavit as one to join the proceeding as an additional petitioner and 
leave to so join and to amend the pleadings and caption is granted. The primary reason for 
compulsory joinder of parties is to avoid multiplicity of actions and to protect non-parties whose 
rights should not be jeopardized if they have a material interest in the subject matter (see, Joanne 
S. v Carey, 1 15 AD2d 4,498 NYS2d 8 17 [ lst 19861). As to the other abutting landowners', the court 
concurs with petitioner that, although interested and affected parties who "ought " to be joined, they 
are not indispensable parties (see, CPLR 1001 (a); Glenwood Head -Glenwood Landing Civic 
Council v Oyster Bay, 88 AD2d 484,453 NYS2d 732 [2d Dept 19821). Accordingly, so much of 
the prior Order which found the other property owners indispensable parties is hereby modified to 
the extent that the Court deems jurisdiction complete with the joinder of the property owner as 
granted above, for purposes of CPLR 103(c). 
Leave to reargue and renew having been granted, and the petition thereby reinstated and 
converted, the court decides the action as follows. 
'Petitioner avers at paragraph #3 1 of the petition that the owner of the five-acre parcel to 
the north of the subject land instituted an Article 78 proceeding entitled Matter of Michael 
Lawlor v Town of Huntington Planning Board, Index No. 20389 -2000, which allegedly seeks to 
annul the preliminary subdivision approval. Examination of the Court's computer records 
reveals that the matter is still pending. Petitioner states that it was not made a party to that 
proceeding. [* 2]

Property in Dispute 
As previously stated, petitioner is the contract vendee of a parcel of property owned by 
Madeline Hogan, also referred to as the “Hogan property” or “Old Orchard Woods,” consisting of 
24.21 acres identified on the Suffolk County Tax Map as 
 0400-001-02-004.001, in an area of 
Huntington known as Eaton’s Neck. Eaton’s Neck is connected to Huntington by a narrow strip of 
land which permits only one lane of traffic in each direction. The largely undeveloped property 
presents a rare and beautiful biologically and geologically sensitive area. It is undisputed that located 
on the Hogan property is a native tulip and oak tree forest, with some of the trees thirty inches in 
diameter, and that this type of mature native forest is unique to Eaton’s Neck, if not the whole of 
Long Island. Some of the other species present include beech, cherry, red maple, black birch and 
sassafras; and part of the property is home to deciduous shrubs, including bracken and Christmas 
ferns and, in the more dense areas, green briar, multiflora rose, grape vine, and poison ivy. It is 
considered an environmentally sensitive area also due to its proximity to fresh water and tidal 
wetlands. The western border of the property consists of eighty foot bluffs overlooking Long Island 
Sound, presents the erosion and contamination problems discussed at length in the Conservation 
Board’s report and the SEQRA statements, and is home to a colony of bank swallows The eastern 
border along North Creek Road is adjacent to two properties; north is the former Morgan Estate, 
zoned R-80 by the Village of Asharoken, and south is part of the Hogan plat sold in 1988. The 
northern border abuts a property which is included in the rezoning. The southern border also abuts 
additional property included in the rezoning, as well as property developed under the R-20 zoning, 
and further south of this, even higher -density residential lots. 
History 
Since, at least 1964, the Hogan property in dispute was within an area zoned R-20, limited 
to one family homes on a minimum of one-half acre. In September of 1998 petitioner made 
application to the Huntington Town Planning Board for subdivision of the parcel. The Town 
Planning Board, as “lead agency,” after extensive review and preparation of an Environmental 
Assessment Form (“EN”), issued a Positive Environmental Declaration pursuant to the State 
Environmental Quality Review Act 
 (“SEQFW”), on March 10, 1999. Thereafter, a Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement (“DEIS”) was prepared and commented on by the Planning Board 
and the Town Conservation Board, wherein various revisions were requested. A joint public hearing 
on the DEIS and preliminary subdivision approval was duly noticed and held on November 17, 
1999. On November 3,1999, the voters of Huntington approved establishment ofthe Environmental 
Open Space and Park Fund (“EOSP”), and the Town Board, by resolution dated November 23,1999, 
authorized the Town Attorney and the EOSP Advisory Counsel to ascertain whether the contract 
vendee (petitioner) or owner of the Hogan property was willing to sell the land, or a portion thereof, [* 3]
I 
Kollmer v Town of Huntington 
Index No. 00-30862 
Page No. 4 
for public preservation, and further authorized the Director of Planning to initiate discussions 
between the Town and public and private agencies (The Nature Conservancy, Trust for Public Land, 
National Audubon Society, as well as County, State, and Federal agencies) to identify any potential 
for shared finding. The resolution directed the Planning Director to advise the contacted agencies 
of the Board’s commitment to protect the property in dispute and to utilize Town funds. Apparently, 
these efforts continue. 
ANotice of Final Environmental Impact Statement 
 (“FEIS”), under SEQRA, issued on April 
27,2000, and, at its July 12,2000 meeting, the Planning Board resolved to approve and adopt the 
Findings Statement under SEQRA and to grant preliminary approval for the subdivision application. 
Thereafter, on July 25,2000 the Town Board resolved to more fully consider a potential rezoning 
of the Hogan property, as well as an additional eight acres, from R-20, permitting a single family 
home on one-half acre, to R-80, permitting a single family home on two acres. The Board quoted 
the Comprehensive Plan Summary, which states at page 6 that “the overall environmental planning 
goal for the town is to assure that additional growth and development are compatible with or enhance 
the town’s natural resources” and in furtherance of this goal the Plan recommends that certain 
strategies be pursued, including: “update zoning, design guidelines and other land use controls as 
a means of regulating the intensity and type of development in critical resource areas”; quoted the 
Environmental Conditions Section in the Comprehensive Plan, at pages 3 -13, relative to the 
constraints to development imposed by natural resources, and severe constraints posed by 
development of areas which would create unavoidable adverse impacts; and quoted the Open Space 
and Historic Resources Section of the Comprehensive Plan which identifies lands in need of planned 
protection to include “( 1) parcels with significant environmental qualities, particularly those needed 
for the protections and maintenance of groundwater recharge areas, wetland, sensitive coastal areas, 
and wildlife habitats and (2) parcels with unique aesthetic, image and /or scenic qualities”; and 
concludes that the proposed rezoning met these criteria. The resolution went on to, inter alia, 
acknowledge that an EAF was needed prior to any action by the Town Board; listed the Town Board 
as lead agency for purposes of SEQRA; scheduled a public hearing on the matter; and 
acknowledged that a public hearing, pursuant 6 NYCRR 6 17.2(b), in no way committed the Town 
Board to an approval of the rezoning and that such determination would follow the completion of 
the SEQRA review. 
By letter dated August 25,2000, the Suffolk County Department of Planning acknowledged 
receipt of the Town’s application relative to the rezoning and opined that the matter was one for local 
determination in that there was no apparent significant county -wide or inter-community impact. A 
Public Hearing was noticed and held August 29, 2000, on the proposed rezoning. Among those 
speaking at the Public Hearing was the Mayor of The Village of Asharoken, who expressed the 
Village’s support for the rezoning. The Full Environmental Assessment Form, in compliance with 
SEQRA, for the proposed rezoning was completed October 4, 2000 and Local Law No. 29 was 
enacted, rezoning the petitioner’s subject property, and eight abutting acres, on October 10,2000. [* 4]

Index No. 00-30862 
PageNo. 5 
The petition contains three arguments in favor of finding the law unconstitutional, illegal and 
(1) that the Town Board’s referral of the proposed zoning change to the Suffolk 
County Planning Commission prior to preparation of the Environmental Assessment 
Form was violative of General Municipal Law 
 $239-m(4)(b); ultra vires: 
(2) that the Board’s failure to refer the proposed rezoning to the Planning Board prior 
to the public hearing of August 29,2000 was violative of Hunting Town Code $ 198- 
127; and 
(3) that the Board violated 6 NYCRR 617.3 (a), in failing to comply with SEQRA 
by, inter alia, failing to take a “hard look” at the rezoning, by instituting the action 
on it own motion in response to public opposition, by finding that the rezoning would 
be compatible with the Town’s Comprehensive Plan, by initiating the rezoning 
without first receiving recommendations of the Planning Board or Department, and 
by failing to consider the contrary findings of petitioner’s expert. 
General Municipal Law $239-m 
General Municipal Law 
 $239-lprovides, at subsection 2., labeled “Intent” that 
“[t]hepurpose 
of this section, sections two hundred 
 thirty-nine-m and two hundred 
 thirty-nine-n of this article shall 
be to bring pertinent inter-community and county -wide planning, zoning, site plan, and subdivision 
considerations to the attention of neighboring municipalities and agencies having jurisdiction.” 
Since the rezoning abuts the Village of Asharoken, it falls under GML $239 -m subsection 3.(b), 
which lists proposed actions that are subject to referral to the Suffolk County Planning Department. 
The gravamen of petitioner’s argument is that, pursuant to GML $239-m (l)(C), the term “full 
statement of such proposed action” shall mean all materials required by and submitted to the 
referring body as an application on a proposed action, including a “completed environmental 
assessment form” and all other materials required by such referring body in order to make its 
determination. Since the July 25, 2000 Board resolution states that the EAF was needed to be 
completed before final action, petitioner argues that the Board violated $239-m (l)(c) by referring 
the rezoning to the Suffolk County Planning Department prior to completion of the EAF. While a 
failure to refer the rezoning to the County Planning Department would have been jurisdictional in 
nature (see, Ernalex Construction v City of Glen Cove, 256 AD2d 336,681 NYS2d 296 [2d Dept 
1998]), that is not the instant scenario. The matter was referred to the County, and the County 
Planning Department responded that the matter was one for local determination, in that there was 
no apparent significant county-wide or inter-community impact. Moreover, GML $239 -m (l)(c) 
also states that 
“[nlotwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, any referring body 
may agree with the county planning agency or regional planning council as to what shall constitute [* 5]
Kollmer v Town of Huntington 
Index No. 00-30862 
Page No. 6 
a "full statement " for any or all of those proposed actions which said 
 refemng body is authorized 
to act upon." Here, the Village of Asharoken, abutting the proposed rezoning, which already zoned 
the abutting property R-80, was strongly in favor of the upzoing, as evinced by its statement at the 
Public Hearing and its Planning Board's recommendation. Further, the referral was not for a 
subdivision which would increase the inter-community traffic, land use, institutional use, 
populations density, etc. as contemplated by GML $239-1 but changed the zoned density from one- 
half acre to two acres, thereby lessening those concerns (see, Ferrari v Town of 
Penjield, 18 1 AD2d 
149, 582 NYS2d 925 
[4th Dept 19921). Moreover, petitioner offers no support for its position that 
absent a clear record of what the refemng body and County agreed was sufficient for the County's 
response, the referral is violative of $239-m (l)(c) and the Local Law must be annulled. 
Huntington Town Code 
Petitioner argues that the Town Board violated provisions of the Town Code by failing to 
refer the rezoning to the Town Planning Board prior to the public hearing. The Huntington Town 
Code provides at $ 198- 126: 
The Town Board may from time to time amend, supplement, modify, 
repeal or change this chapter or the Zoning Map on its own motion, 
on petition or application or on recommendation of the Planning 
Board but only after a public hearing has been held before the Town 
Board to consider said change of zone; and 
at $198 -127: 
The Town Board shall refer changes of zone change proposals to the 
Planning Board for recommendation and written report thereon, 
unless specifically determined otherwise, as provided in $ 198-128 
herein. The Town Board may specify a reasonable time within which 
such report shall be submitted, and no public hearing shall be held 
until such report has been received or the specified time has elapsed. 
When a statute is reasonably free from ambiguity, a court must construe it so as to give effect 
to its plain meaning (see, Doctors Cozrncil v New York City 
Empfoyees'Retirement Sys., 71 NY2d 
669, 529 NYS2d 732 [1988]; 
 McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes $4 76,94). The " 
plain and obvious meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or hidden sense 
that nothing but a strained interpretation of legislative intent would discern. " Courts "may only look 
behind the words of a statute when the law itself is doubtful or ambiguous " (see, Finger Lakes 
Racing Assri. v New York State Racing & Wagering Bd., 45 NY2d 471,410 NYS2d 268 [ 19781). 
Here, respondent argues that since the zoning change was instituted by its own motion, the 
mandatory referral need not have been made before the public hearing, as opposed to 
 $198-128 [* 6]
Kollmer v Town of Huntington 
Page No. 7 - Index No. 00-30862 . 
applications for change of zone by property owners, which mandates referral to the Town attorney 
and Director of Planning and sets a thirty (30) day limitation for the forwarding of a synopsis of the 
application to the Town Board. The Court agrees that the referral made after the public hearing does 
not violate the Town Code. A reading of 
$198-126 indicates that the Town Board is empowered to 
amend, supplement, modify, repeal or change the Zoning Map and lists three ways such these 
changes are instituted: by the Town Board's own motion, on recommendation ofthe Planning Board, 
or on petition or application by other than the Town Board or Planning Board. If the court accepts 
petitioner's reading of 
$198-127, the Town Board would need to refer to the Planning Board 
changes to the Zoning Map instituted by the Planning Board itself before the public hearing could 
be held. The court is unable to conclude that petitioner's interpretation is supported by the plain 
language of $198 -127 (see, Yong-Myun Rho 
 vAmbach, 74 NY2d 318,546 NYS2d 1005 [1989]); 
Doctors Council v New York City Employees 'Retirement Sys., supra). Moreover, 
 5 198-127 states 
that the Town Board shall refer changes of zone change 
 proPosals (emphasis added) to the Planning 
Board, which would mean that if the Town Board's or Planning Board's own recommendation was 
then changed, the changed recommendation would than be referred to the Planning Board before any 
public hearing on the change. 
SEQRA 
The 
fimdamental policy of the State Environmental Quality Review Act 
(SEQ-RA; ECL Art 
8) "is to inject environmental considerations directly into govemmental decision making " (see, 
Matter of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. vBoard 
 ofEstimate, 72 NY2d 674,536 NYS2d 33 [ 19881). This 
policy is effectuated, in part, through strict compliance with the review procedures outlined in the 
environmental laws and regulations (see, Matter of King v Saratoga County Bd. of Supervisors, 89 
NY2d 341, 653 NYS2d 233 [1996]). Initially, a determination must be made as to whether the 
action qualifies as a Type I, Type I1 or an unlisted action for purposes of SEQRA review (6 NYCRR 
617.5 (a) (4)). 6 NYCRR 617.2(b) defines a "Type I" action (see also, 617.4), a "Type 11" action 
(see also, 617.5), as well as an "Unlisted action. " An "unlisted action " is one "not identified as a 
Type I or Type I1 action " in this Part, or, in the case of a particular agency action, not identified as 
a Type I or Type I1 action in the agency's own SEQRA procedures. " An unlisted action must also 
contain a "Negative declaration, " which means a written determination by a lead agency that the 
implementation of the action as proposed will not result in any significant adverse environmental 
impacts (6 17.2 (b)(y). . 
The respondent submitted a Full Environmental Assessment Form (FEN), dated October 
4, 2000, which found the SEQRA recommendation for the proposed rezoning to be a "negative 
declaration " and based its recommendation on the SEQRA classification "Unlisted, " in that it did 
not meet or exceed any of the action listed on the Type I list (6 NYCRR 6 17.4(b); cited the SEQRA 
history of the property in dispute; established the Town Board as lead agency for the purposes of 
complying with SEQRA (61 7.6(b)( l), in that the action did not involve another agency; and stated [* 7]
, 
Kollmer v Town of Huntington 
Index No. 00-30862 
PageNo. 8 
that rezoning the property to a lower density appeared to be the most prudent land use measure that 
could be implemented on a local level to diminish the potential adverse impact related to 
development, while preserving the economic value. Included in the FEAF were findings that the 
proposed rezoning would not impact on the land, would not impact on the surface and groundwater, 
would not impact on the air quality, would not impact on any threatened and/or endangered species, 
would not affect agricultural resources, would not impact on historic and archaeological resources, 
and had the potential to reduce future impacts to open space, groundwater, costal bluffs, wetlands, 
and marine resources. It further found no impact on critical environmental areas, transportation, 
energy, noise and odor, public health, and found the reduction in density consistent with the 1993 
Comprehensive Plan. The FEAF also acknowledged that, although the rezoning would lessen the 
adverse impact of any future development of the property, additional review, pursuant to SEQRA, 
would be needed at the time any site -specific development applications were made. 
It is well settled that "strict " as opposed to "substantial" compliance with SEQRA, and the 
regulations promulgated thereunder, is required (see, Matter of Rye 
Town/King Civic Assn. v Town 
ofRye, 82 AD2d 474,422 NYS2d 67 [2d Dept 19811, upp dism 55 NY2d 747, lv dism 56 NY2d 985 
'[1982]; Matter of Martin v Koppelman, 124 AD2d 24, 510 NYS2d 881 [2d Dept 19871.) In 
reviewing determinations concerning environmental matters courts are limited to determining 
whether the authorities involved have complied with the procedural requirements of SEQRA (see, 
Matter 
 ofMartin v Koppelman, supra). Pursuant to 61 7.2 (m), an Environmental Assessment Form 
(EAF) means a form used by an agency to assist it in determining the environmental significance or 
nonsignificance of actions, and states that a properly completed EAF must contain enough 
information to describe the proposed action, its location, its purpose and its potential impacts on the 
environment. The court is unable to find that the FEAF submitted by respondent deviated fiom that 
standard or that it violated the statute (see, Burclzetta v Town Board of the Town of Carmel, 140 
Misc2d 1050,532 NYS2d 620 [Sup Ct. Putnam Co. 19881, ~$267 AD2d 339,561 NYS2d 305 [2d 
Dept 19901). The court is also unable to find that the classification of the action as "unlisted " 
violated the statute. The court is unpersuaded by petitioner's argument that, by the Town Board's 
contemplation that another examination of any future proposed subdivision would be needed, the 
Board did not take a "hard look" (see H.O.M.E.S. v New York State Urban Dev. Corp., 69 AD2d 
222,418 NYS2d 827 
[4th Dept 19791) at the instant rezoning for the purposes of SEQRA. 
As to petitioner's remaining arguments, it is an elementary but significant principal of law 
that a legislative enactment will be presumed constitutional (see, Wiggins v Town of Somers, 4 
NY2d 215, 173 NYS2d 579 [ 19571). "The exceedingly strong presumption of constitutionality 
applies not only to enactments of the Legislature but to ordinances of municipalities as well. While 
this presumption is rebuttable, unconstitutionality must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt 
and only as a last resort should courts strike down legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality " 
(see, 
 Liglzthouse Shores v Town of Islip, 41 NY2d 7, 390 NYS2d 827 [1976]). To withstand 
judicial scrutiny, a municipality's exercise of its zoning power "must be founded upon a legislative 
delegation to so proceed " (see, Matter of Golden v Planning Bd. of Town of Ramapo, 30 NY2d [* 8]
Kollmer v Town of Huntington 
Index No. 00-30862 
Page No. 9 
359,334 NYS2d 138 [ 19721). Such a legislative delegation is found in section 261 of the Town Law 
which empowers the town board, “[for] the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals, or the 
general welfare of the community, . . . to regulate and restrict”, inter alia, thedensity of population 
and preservation ofopen space (see, Daniels v Van Voris, 241 AD2d 796,660 NYS2d 758 
[3rd Dept 
19971; Marcus v Town of Huntington, 45 NY2d 501, 410 NYS2d 546 [1978]). The rezoning 
enacted by Local Law No.29 is well within the ambit of this broad grant (see, Maldini v Ambro, 36 
NY2d 481,369 NYS2d 385 [ 19751). Nor has petitioner alleged that “no reasonable return may be 
had from any permitted use” (see, McGowan v Cohalan, 41 NY2d 434,393 NYS2d 376 [ 19771). 
Further, the Town has established a reasonable nexus between the Town’s legitimate objectives and 
the rezoning, even if “triggered” by petitioner’s initial subdivision application (see, Thomas v Town 
ofBedford, 11 NY2d 428,230 NYS2d 684 [ 19621; Marcus v Town 
 ofHuntington, supra). Lastly, 
the Town may change its zoning to promote the general welfare and to respond to changed 
conditions in the community, in accordance with its Comprehensive Plan (see, Bonnie Briar 
Syndicate v Town of Mamaroneck, 94 NY2d 96,699 NYS2d 72 1 [ 19991; Gernatt Asphalt v Town 
of Sardina, 87 NY2d 668,642 NYS2d 164 [ 19961; Rodgers v Village of Tarrytown, 302 NY 115 
. [1951]). 
In light of the affidavit of Madeline Hogan consenting to and joining in the requested relief, 
the petition is deemed amended to add her as an additional petitioner. The court having deemed 
jurisdiction complete, and acting within its power to treat an CPLR Article 78 proceeding as an 
action for a declaratory judgment (CPLR 103(c)), issues the following declaration: Local Law No. 
29, enacted by the Huntington Town Board is not unconstitutional, illegal or ultra vires as enacted.
