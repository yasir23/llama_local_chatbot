This personal injury action is currently on the ready day trial calendar. The infant plaintiffs were 
burned in a fire at the home their parents rented from defendants. Moving defendants seek, initially, to 
preclude plaintiffs expert from testifying as to theories of liabilitynot raised in plaintiffs’ bill ofparticulars 
and precluding plaintiffs from amending their bill of particulars. The premises was left vacant after the fire 
on January 27, 1997. In December 1997 defendants notified plaintiffs that the Town had directed the 
property be demolished, and that the property would be demolished within two weeks. Defendants also 
requested that, in response to their expert witness demand, plaintiffs communicate any anticipated expert 
witness, so that defendants could have their own expert examine the property before its demolition. 
Defendants also stated that they would object to the calling of any expert witness not identified prior to the 
demolition. 
In May2001 plaintiffs served defendants with expert disclosure (CPLR 3 101 [d]), wherein the expert 
is expected to testify, inter alia, that the fire was accidental and caused by a portable space heater coming 
into contact with combustible material; that the heaters were used because the house was cold and did not 
have adequate heat; that the dwelling did not have operable smoke detectors; and that this lack led to a 
delayed awareness of the fire and was the direct and proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries. 
The gravamen of defendants motions is that plaintiffs’ May 2001 expert witness disclosure, coming 
some three years after the premises was demolished is untimely and prejudicial, and the plaintiffs’ bill of 
particulars does not contain any allegations that the dwelling’s heat was inadequate. 
Pursuant to CPLR 3101(a), “there shall be full disclosure of all evidence material and necessary in 
the prosecution or defense of an action, regardless of the burden of proof. . .” Although CPLR 3 101 (d)( 1) 
requires disclosure of each parties expert and their expected testimony, it does not require a party to respond 
to a demand for such expert information at any specific time nor does it mandate that a party be precluded 
from proffering expert testimony merely because ofnoncompliance with the statute, unless there is evidence 
of intentional or willful failure to disclose and a showing of prejudice by the opposing party (see, 
Cutsogeorge Y Hertz, 262 AD2d 752,695 NYS2d 375 [2d Dept 19991). Further, “as a matter of elementary 
fairness” loss or destruction of physical evidence which is crucial to defense of an action may be so 
prejudicial as to warrant dismissal, even where such destruction was outside of plaintiffs control (see, 
Behrbom Y Healthco International, AD2d -, 2001 NY App Div LEXIS 7575 [2d Dept 20011). 
However, here defendants were in control of the dwelling and were not prohibited from having an expert 
inspect it before its demolition. 
The court finds that the extreme remedy of preclusion is unwarranted under the present 
circumstances (see, Busse v Clark Equipment Co., 182 AD2d 525,538 NYS2d 243 [lst Dept 19921). The 
parties do not dispute that plaintiffs’ bill of particulars lists alleged violations of Riverhead Town Code at 
586-9, as well as NYCRR 5721.1, § 1060.1, and 0 1060.3, all of which address the requirements relative to 
smoke and fire detectors. Defendants’ bill of particulars asserts plaintiffs’ culpable conduct with respect 
to use and placement of space heaters. Therefore defendants were aware of the use of space heaters and the [* 2 ]

alleged violation regarding smoke detectors. Moreover, it appears that plaintiffs’ expert’s conclusions are 
not based on an examination of the subject premises and that the materials reviewed in forming his opinion 
are available to defendants. Therefore, the motion and cross motion for preclusion are denied, since a willful 
and contumacious failure to disclose was not established, nor have movants established surprise or prejudice 
(see, Vega v Lapalorcia, - AD2d -, 722 NYS2d 563 [2d Dept 20011; Blade v Town of North 
Hempstead, 277 AD2d 268, 715 NYS2d 735 [2d Dept 20001; Halley v Winnicki, 252 AD2d 489, 681 
NYS2d 60 [2d Dept 19981). 
Lastly, defendant Loscalzo seeks to stay the trial of this matter pending the perfection and subsequent 
hearing of his appeal. The subject of defendant’s appeal is the Order of Supreme Court, dated February 20, 
2001 (Hon. Donald Kitson, J.S.C.) which denied his motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs’ 
complaint. Although, staying of a pending action is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court (see, 
CPLR 2201; Britt v International Bus Services, Inc., 255 AD2d 143, 679 NYS2d 616 [lst Dept 1998]), 
defendant has not offered any statutory or case law support for his request relative to the instant 
circumstances (compare, In re Weinbaum’s Estate, 51 Misc2d 538, 272 NYS2d 461 [1966]), and it is 
denied. [* 3 ]
