The plaintiff, Annette Giangrasso, a mentally retarded adult, commenced this 
action by her conservator alleging that while being transported by the defendant Towne 
Transport Bus Company (hereinafter "Towne Bus") to and from a workshop operated by 
the defendant, Association for Help of Retarded Children (hereinafter "AHRC"), she was [* 1 ]
Index No. 14514/1993 Page 2. 
sexually assaulted and molested by Mark Britton, an employee of Towne Bus. 
incident occurred in 1993. Mark Britton has entered a plea of guilty to a criminal charge 
stemming from the incident. The 
The plaintiff has expanded her claims during the seven years of this lawsuit, 
claiming that AHRC failed to provide adequate supervision of the defendant Towne Bus’ 
activities and that the defendant Towne Bus negligently hired, trained and supervised 
Mark Britton, and should have had another employee on the bus. 
Summary judgment has been denied by Order of this Court dated September 27, 
1996. In denying summary judgment this Court permitted inquiry into the custom in the 
industry regarding psychological testing and the degree of investigation into the moral 
character of bus drivers and stated that Article 19-A of the Vehicle and Traffic Law sets 
minimum not absolute requirements for the hiring of bus drivers. 
Discovery has been conducted under the supervision of a Referee, with a view 
towards protecting the rights of other persons involved in incidents which may be 
germane to this case. The Referee, Harvey Besunder, Esq., was appointed by Order 
dated September 29, 1998. 
The issue for resolution at this time is whether a Dr. Edward F. Dragan may 
testify as an expert for the plaintiff concerning custom and usage in the special 
education field concerning: I] the hiring, screening, training, supervision and retention 
of bus drivers; 21 the duty of schools or districts to monitor transportation contractors; 
and 31 safety and supervision of clients on buses. Dr. Dragan also intends to testify 
regarding the capabilities and vulnerabilities of mentally retarded adults with respect to 
sexual abuse. The Court has before it motions by Towne Bus and AHRC to preclude [* 2 ]
Index No. I451411993 Page 3. 
to preclude such testimony and a cross motion by the plaintiff for the Court to rule in 
limine that such testimony is admissible. 
Initially the Court notes that when considering issues of the admissibility of expert 
testimony, particularly where, as here, issues of reliability and acceptability are 
presented, the most appropriate procedural vehicle is the pre-trial motion to preclude or 
the pre-trial in limine motion to permit. In no other way can proper trial preparation 
occh-. Importantly, this procedure can only be effective if there has been complete and 
proper compliance with the requisites of CPLR 31 Ol(d). 
Dr. Dragan has submitted a report dated September 27, 2000, in which he states 
that the objective of the assignment was to present an opinion as to whether AHRC and 
Towne Bus acted reasonably, prudently, and within accepted practice and standard of 
care when providing for the supervision and safety of clients. Dr. Dragan’s resume 
indicates that he is a “Special Education Expert ...( and) Certified School Administrator 
(and) Certified Management Consultant”. Dr. Dragan has served as a Director-Division 
of Special Services dealing with issues relating to children with disabilities and has 
taught, as an Adjunct Professor, courses relating to persons with disabilities. Dr. 
Dragan has an educational background indicating he has taken courses dealing with 
persons with disabilities, and courses dealing with issues relating to sexual abuse and 
transportation of persons with disabilities. Dr. Dragan has also been involved in the 
hiring of bus drivers and the supervision of transportation of students with disabilities. 
Dr. Dragan opines that AHRC failed to develop an anti-sexual abuse policy; failed 
to provide adequate supervision for the plaintiff, and failed to assure Towne Bus drivers [* 3 ]
Index No. 14514/1993 Page 4. 
were adequately trained. Dr. Dragan states that there is no evidence of any policy 
regarding training for drivers of individuals with mental disabilities. Dr. Dragan opines at 
length about the nature of individuals with mental disabilities and the nature of abusers 
of such individuals. Dr. Dragan‘s opinion/report is predicated, in large measure, upon 
literature 
Dr. Dragan reviewed the deposition of Pat Zilko, the Personnel Director of Towne 
Bus and the deposition of Beverly Geiger, a Director of the Work Activities Program at 
AHRC, as well as Natale Leo, Administrator of Workshop Operations of AHRC. No 
training or supervision was provided to Mark Britton by the defendant Towne Bus, or 
required of Towne Bus by AHRC. That failure according to Dr. Dragan “contributed to 
Annette’s sexual abuse”. 
Dr. Dragan also reviewed a report prepared by the Referee, Harvey Besunder, 
Esq. concerning incidents involving misconduct. Dr. Dragan claims that the report is 
substantially inadequate because of a lack of information as to, for example, the 
number of incidents involving the driver, Mark Britton. Dr. Dragon does conclude that 
from the number of incidents, there is a need for closer supervision. 
In support of its motion to preclude the expert testimony of Dr. Dragan, Towne 
Bus argues that the plaintiff does not need expert testimony to establish negligent hiring, 
retention, supervision or control; that the opinions of the plaintiff’s expert would 
unnecessarily and improperly intrude upon the province of the jury, and that the 
plaintiff‘s expert intends to testify that the defendants violated a common-law duty to 
institute specific procedures for hiring employees, for which there is no common-law 
duty. AHRC joins in Towne Bus’ opposition. AHRC also argues that the plaintiffs [* 4 ]
Index No. 14514/1993 Page 5. 
liability expert has failed to identify any particular industry custom, practice or standard 
of care claimed to be violated by the defendants, and has failed to indicate that 
workshop programs for persons of the age and IQ of Denise Giangrasso would provide 
for bus matrons. 
In support of her motion to permit the expert testimony, the plaintiff argues that 
Dr. Dragan is qualified to opine on the proposed topics; that Dr. Dragan’s testimony will 
assist the trier of fact; that expert testimony is appropriate for issues of supervision and 
safety, and that Dr. Dragan could assist the jury by helping them understand the 
vulnerabilities of mentally retarded adults. The plaintiff also argues that a Magistrate 
for the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, permitted Dr. Dragan to offer 
expert testimony as to educational hiring and screening procedures and proper 
monitoring of transportation contractors in a case involving a developmentally disabled 
child who was sexually molested by a bus driver (Doe v. Mercer County Special 
Services, Civil Action No. 95-5893 [D.N.J. 19981). The plaintiff also argues that the 
“general acceptance” test (Fwe v. United States, 293 F. 101 3 [I 9231) is not 
applicable and that Dr. Dragan’s testimony would satisfy the Daubed and Kumho Tire 
“reliability” test (Daubed v. Merrell Dow Pharms. Inc., 509 US 579 [1993]; Kumho 
Tire Co. Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 US 137 [1999]). 
Whether or not expert testimony is admissible on a particular point, and the 
bounds thereof, is a mixed question of law and fact addressed primarily to the sound 
discretion of the trial court (see People v. Cronin, 60 NY2d 430, 470 NYS2d 110 
[1983]; Selkowitz v. Countv of Nassau, 45 NY 2d 97,408 NYS2d 10 [1978]). As a 
general rule the expert should be permitted to offer an opinion on an issue which [* 5 ]
Index No. 14514/1993 Page 6. 
involves professional or scientific knowledge or skill not within the range of ordinary 
training and intelligence (see Douaherfv v. Milliken, 163 NY 527 [I 9001). It is for the 
trial court in the first instance to determine when jurors are able to draw conclusions 
from the evidence based on their day to day experience, their common observation and 
their knowledge, and when they would be benefited by the specialized knowledge of an 
expert witness (see People v. Cronin, 60 NY2d 430, supra). The guiding principle is 
thatexpert opinion is proper when it would help to clarify an issue calling for 
professional or technical knowledge, possessed by the expert and beyond the ken of 
the typical juror (see DeLonq v. Counfv of Erie, 60 NY2d 296, 469 NYS2d 61 1 [1983]). 
Indeed, even if the proposed testimony was not beyond the jury’s ken, the Court of 
Appeals has upheld the admission of expert testimony for the purpose of clarifying an 
area of which the jurors have a general awareness (see People v. Mooney, 76 NY2d 
827, 560 NYS2d 1 15 [I 990][Kaye dissent]; Selkowifz v. County of Nassau, 45 NY2d 
97, supra; Delonq v. County of Erie, 60 NY2d 296, supra). 
Significantly, in a case in which the conclusions to be drawn from the facts 
stated, as well as knowledge of the facts themselves, depend upon professional or 
scientific knowledge or skill not within the range of ordinary training and intelligence, the 
qualified expert may testify not only to facts, but the conclusions to which they lead (see 
Dougherfv v.Milliken, 163 NY 527, supra; see also Schufz v. Union Railwav, Co., 
181 NY 33 [1905]). Where the expert states the facts and gives his conclusion in the 
form of an opinion, it remains for the jury to accept or reject such opinion (see 
Douqhertv v. Milliken, 163 NY 527, supra). The test is one of need to be applied to 
the unique circumstances of each case (see Dufel v. Green, 84 NY2d 795,622 NYS2d [* 6 ]
Index No. 1451411993 Page 7. 
900 [1995]). If the jury requires the benefit of the expert’s specialized knowledge, the 
expert’s opinion should be allowed even when it bears on an ultimate question (see 
Dufel v. Green, 84 NY2d 795, supra, citing Fisch, New York Evidence § 413 at 264 
[2d ed]). 
It has been said that “[iln a sense, opinion testimony of an expert witness 
necessarily enters upon the juror’s province since the expert - and not the jury - draws 
conclusions from the facts, which the jury is then asked to adopt” (People v. Cronin, 60 
NY2d 433, supra; see also People v. Miller, 91 NY2d 372,670 NYS2d 978 [1998]). 
Both sides, of course, may cross examine and impeach the opposition’s experts and 
adduce different opinions through their own experts (see People v. Cronin, 60 NY2d 
433, supra; Selkowitz v. Countv of Nassau, 45 NY2d 97, supra). As noted above, it 
remains for the jury to accept or reject any opinion presented (see Douaherfv v. 
Milliken, 163 NY 527, supra). 
Turning from the general to the specific, the Court observes that expert testimony 
has been found to be permissible in the areas of the supervision and safety of children 
(see e.g. Maness v. Citv of New York, 201 AD2d 347, 607 NYS2d 325 [I 9941; Amato 
v. Hudson Countrv Montessori Sch., 185 AD2d 803, 586 NYS2d 635 [ 19921; Chan v. 
Board of Educ. Citv of NY, 162 AD2d 576, 557 NYS2d 91 [I 9901; Franck v. Minisink 
Vallev Sch. Dist., 130 AD2d 588, 523 NYS2d 573 [I 9881); the supervision and safety of 
mentally retarded children (see e.g. Rodriquez v. Board of Educ. City of NY, 104 
AD2d 978, 480 NYS2d 901 [1984]), and the capabilities, limitations and vulnerabilities of 
developmentally disabled adults (see e.g. Matter ofJoyce T., 65 NY2d 39, 489 NYS2d 
705 [I 9851; Matter of Abby B., 269 AD2d 81 9, 703 NYS2d 780 [2000]). The Court also [* 7 ]
observes that experts may opine as to standards of care and the breach thereof (see 
generally Porfilla v. Rodriguez, 179 AD2d 631, 578 NYS2d 241 [I 9921; Robillard v. 
Robbins, 168 AD2d 803, 563 NYS2d 940 [I9901 affd 78 NY2d 1105, 578 NYS2d 126 
[1991]). Upon the principles discussed above, the Court finds that the defendants’ 
arguments that expert testimony is unnecessary to establish negligent hiring, retention, 
supervision or control, that an expert opinion will unnecessarily intrude upon the 
province of the jury and that it is not proper for an expert to testify as to duty, standard 
of care and breaches thereof, are unpersuasive and pose no absolute impediment to 
the proposed testimony herein. 
The Court will now address the issue of the standard to be applied in determining 
whether an expert’s opinion may properly be presented to, and considered by, the jury. 
Initially, the Court notes that neither defendant offered argument or authority on this 
issue on the present applications, although the plaintiff did. The Court also notes that 
on a prior application subsequent to a July 5, 2000 Court Conference all parties 
submitted letters to the Court setting forth their respective positions on the standard to 
be applied. A review of these letters reveals that the parties are in essential agreement 
that the Dauberf and Kumho Tire reliability standard should be applied by this Court in 
determining whether Dr. Dragan should be permitted to testify on the topics proposed. 
Additionally, Towne Bus argues that this Court should, as it did in Wahl v. American 
Honda Motor Co., (181 Misc2d 396, 693 NYS2d 875 [1999]) conduct a hearing in 
which the “defendants should be allowed to cross-examine Dr. Dragan as to the exact 
content of his proposed testimony, as well as the relevance of said testimony to the 
facts of the case”. [* 8 ]
Index No. 14514/1993 Page 9. 
As this Court observed in Wahl, where the evidence is not scientific or not novel, 
the “general acceptance” test of Fwe v. United States (293F. 101 3, supra) is not 
applicable (citing People v. Persuad, 244 AD2d 577, 665 NYS2d 671 [I9971 app den 91 
NY2d 976,672 NYS2d 885 [1998]; People v. Roraback, 242 AD2d 400,662 NYS2d 
327 [I9971 app den 91 NY2d 879,668 NYS2d 577 [1997]; People v. DiNonno, 171 
Misc2d 335, 659 NYS2d 390 [1997]; see also “Considering the ‘Frye’ Rule in New York 
Justice”, Hon. Walter J. Relihan, Jr., NYLJ Sept 15, 2000, P. 1 Col. 1). In the case at 
bar, the proposed testimony of Dr. Dragan would be of a professional nature rather than 
a scientific or technical nature. As such, the Frye “general acceptance” test is not the 
appropriate standard. In this regard, the Court notes that Chief Judge Kaye in her 
dissent in People v. Moonev (76 NY2d, supra) stated that the Fwe standard is not “the 
appropriate standard to be applied to the testimony of a qualified psychologist who 
proposes to explain to the jury how certain factors shown by the record can affect 
perception and memory, and thus the accuracy of identification testimony”. The Court, 
therefore, is in agreement with the parties that the appropriate test to be applied is the 
reliability standard as derives from Daubed and Kumho Tire and not the more stringent 
Frve standard. 
In Daubed v. Merrell Dow Pharms. lnc. (509 US 579, supra) the United States 
Supreme Court focused on the admissibility of scientific expert testimony, stating that 
such testimony is admissible only if it is both relevant and reliable. The Supreme Court 
held that it was the task of the trial judge to ensure that an expert’s testimony both rests 
on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand (509 US at 597). The 
Supreme Court also discussed certain factors, such as testing, peer review, error rates, 
and acceptability in the relevant scientific community, some or all of which might prove [* 9 ]
Index No. 14514/1993 Page IO. 
helpful in determining the reliability of a particular scientific theory or technique (509 US 
at 593-594). 
In Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael(526 US 137, supra) the United States 
Supreme Court ruled that Daubed’s general holding, setting forth the trial judge’s 
general “gate-keeping” obligation applies not only to testimony based on scientific 
knowledge, but also to testimony based on technical and other specialized knowledge 
(526 US at 141). The Supreme Court also ruled that the trial court may consider one or 
more of the specific Daubed factors when doing so will help determine the reliability of 
proposed testimony (526 US at 141). The Supreme Court stated that the test of 
reliability is flexible; that the specific Daubed factors neither necessarily nor exclusively 
applies to all experts or in every case, and that the trial court has broad discretion in the 
manner in which it determines reliability in light of the particular facts and circumstances 
of the particular case (526 US at 141; 149-150). 
In discussing how the evidentiary rationale that underlies the Court’s basic 
Daubed “gate-keeping” determination is not to be limited to “scientific” knowledge, the 
Supreme Court in Kumho Tire observed that “it would prove difficult, if not impossible, 
for judges to administer evidentiary rules under which a gate-keeping obligation 
depended upon a distinction between ‘scientific’ knowledge and ‘technical’ or ‘other 
specialized’ knowledge” (526 US at 148). The Court further observed 
Neither is there a convincing need to make such distinctions. 
Experts of all kinds tie observations to conclusions through 
the use of what Judge Learned Hand called “general truths 
derived from ... specialized experience”. Hand, Historical 
and Practical Considerations Regarding expert Testimony, [* 10 ]
Index No. 14514/1993 Page 11. 
15 Harv. L. Rev. 40, 54 (1901). And whether the specific 
expert testimony focuses upon specialized observations, the 
specialized translation of those observations into theory, a 
specialized theory itself, or the application of such a theory in 
a particular case, the expert’s testimony often will rest “upon 
an experience confessedly foreign in kind to [the jury’s] own”. 
The trial judge’s effort to assure that the specialized 
testimony is reliable and relevant can help the jury evaluate 
that foreign experience, whether the testimony reflects 
scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge. 
(526 US at 148-149). In this regard, the Court notes that the New York Court of 
Appeals in Price v. New York Cify Hous. Aufh. (92 NY2d 553, 684 NYS2d 143 [1998]) 
observed that although the expert witness “did not have formal training in psychology or 
the behavioral sciences, an expert may be qualified without specialized academic 
training through ‘long observation and actual experience”’ and that “an expert’s 
competency can be derived just as well ‘from the real world of everyday use’ as from a 
I ab o ra t o ry ” . 
The background and experience of Dr. Dragan, the areas of his proposed 
testimony and the essence of his opinions and conclusions were discussed above. Also 
discussed above are the factors and principles which guide the trial court in performing 
its “gate-keeping” function to assure that the proposed testimony of an expert is 
sufficiently reliable, trustworthy and relevant so as to be presented to, and considered 
by, the jury. 
Testimony similar to that which the plaintiff seeks to have Dr. Dragan offer to the [* 11 ]
Index No. 14514/1993 Page 12. 
jury in the case at bar was permitted by Magistrate Judge Wolfson in the case of Doe v. 
Mercer Countv Special Services mentioned above. As noted, the 
concerned a developmentally disabled child who was sexually molested by a bus driver. 
The Magistrate permitted Dr. Dragan to opine as to whether supervision of an employee 
comported with established standards in the education industry and whether there was 
a proper training of employees. The Magistrate did not permit Dr. Dragan to opine as to 
whether abuse would have occurred if proper training and supervision occurred, and 
whether based on certain facts a report of misconduct should have been filed. Although 
this decision is instructive, it does not mandate admission of the proposed testimony in 
the case at bar because of the distinguishing facts of a mentally retarded adult being 
transported to and from a workshop program, as opposed to a developmentally disabled 
infant being transported to and from a school offering special education programs. case 
In denying Towne Bus’ motion for summary judgment dismissing the Complaint 
in 1996, this Court found that genuine issues of material fact were presented as to the 
negligent hiring and/or negligent retention of Mark Britton which requires both denial of 
Towne Bus’ motion for summary judgment and exploration during pre-trial discovery. 
This Court wrote: 
In particular, the plaintiffs may explore during pre-trial 
discovery the nature of the moral character investigations 
performed by other bus companies which transport 
handicapped individuals; whether other bus companies 
which transport handicapped individuals perform 
psychological testing on potential employees, and the nature [* 12 ]
Index No. 14514/1993 Page 13. 
and extent thereof; the steps other bus companies which 
transport handicapped individuals take against drivers who 
have a history of traffic infractions and accidents; what steps 
were taken by AHRC when notified by Lucille Giangrasso on 
two occasions of incidents involving bus drivers (at least one 
with Mark Britton); whether AHRC notified Towne Bus; 
whether AHRC was obligated to notify Towne Bus, and if 
notified what Towne Bus was obligated to do and what 
Towne Bus, in fact, did with respect to the two incidents. 
The question is whether Dr. Dragan is qualified to offer testimony as an expert 
concerning custom and usage in the special education field concerning the hiring, 
screening, training, supervision and retention of bus drivers; the duty of schools or 
districts to monitor transportation contractors and the safety and supervision of clients or 
buses, as well as concerning the capabilities and vulnerabilities of mentally retarded 
adults with respect to sexual abuse. The companion question is whether the foundation 
for the proposed testimony is sufficient to permit the jury to hear and consider such 
testimony. 
Dr. Dragan’s conclusions as to the adequacy of the training, investigation and 
supervision by the defendants are offered in the context of the transportation of an adult 
with disabilities supported by reference to numerous articles and treatises whose 
relevancy the Court finds cannot be determined upon papers alone. Although Dr. 
Dragan appears to possess sufficient background to opine as to characteristics of 
persons with disabilities, insofar as such characteristics are relevant to the issues at [* 13 ]
Index No. 1451411 993 Page 14. 
bar, there is an absence of material showing the relevant standards appropriate to this 
case. Inasmuch as the issue is the reasonableness of training, supervision and 
investigation, the expert’s opinion must be demonstrated to be on a sound footing - a 
result which if it can be achieved at all, this Court finds cannot be achieved based upon 
only a report containing conclusions buttressed in large measure upon articles and 
treatises not made available to the Court. With respect to the written materials the 
Court is mindful that the materials must be of a kind accepted in the profession as 
reliable in forming a professional opinion (see People v. Susden, 35 NY2d 458, 363 
NYS2d 923 [1974]; see also Hambsch v. New York City Trans. Auth., 63 NY2d 723, 
480 NYS2d 195 [1984]). The Court is also mindful that Dr. Dragan cannot be used as a 
mere conduit for the presentation and admission of what otherwise would be excluded 
as hearsay of another expert that bolster the testifying expert’s opinion (see 
Hutchinson v. Groskin, 927 F 2d 722 [1991]; see also People v. Griffin, 985 P2d 15 
119981 [Colorado Ct of Aps]). 
Although the defendant, AHRC has offered the report of its own expert, Margaret 
M. Groce, MS, to dispute the opinions and conclusions of Dr. Dragan, the defendants 
have not been afforded the opportunity to challenge Dr. Dragan’s opinions and 
conclusions upon cross examination. Given that much of the basis for Dr. Dragan’s 
opinions and conclusions derives from articles and treatises, and given that the 
defendant AHRC has produced its own expert to refute Dr. Dragan’s opinions and 
conclusions, the Court finds that it cannot appropriately determine the question of the 
reliability, trustworthiness and relevancy of the proposed testimony of Dr. Dragan 
without an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, Towne Bus and AHRC’s motions to [* 14 ]
Index No. 14514/1993 Page 15. 
preclude Dr. Dragan’s testimony and the plaintiffs cross motion to permit Dr. Dragan’s 
testimony are determined to the extent of this hearing, only, at the present time. 
This Court will now address Towne Bus’ CPLR 3215 motion for a default 
judgment as against the third-party defendant. Towne Bus did not submit an Affidavit of 
Service of the Third-party Summons and Third-party Complaint upon Mark Britton 
(CPLR 321 5M). The Third-party Complaint is not verified and no Affidavit of Merit 
was submitted (CPLR 321 5M). There is no proof that the third-party defendant, Mark 
Britton, was served with all prior pleadings in the action within 120 days of filing of the 
Third-party Summons and the Third-party Complaint as required by CPLR 1007. 
Finally, more than one year has passed from the time of the purported default to the 
time of application to enter a default judgment, and the third-party plaintiff has made no 
attempt to show why the Third-party Complaint should not be dismissed (CPLR 
321 5[cJ). Accordingly, the motion for a default judgment is denied and the Third-party 
Complaint is dismissed by operation of CPLR 3215[c] and CPLR 1007 and CPLR 306- 
b(a) (see Alexander Practice Commentaries, McKinney’s Cons. Laws of NY, Book 78,
