DECISION AND ORDER 
THE UPPER CRUST, INC. DANIEL M. FEHLIG, 
BANKERS TRUST COMPANY, and DEUTSCHE BANK 
Defendants The Upper Crust ("TUCII) and Daniel M. Fehlig move, 
pursuant to CPLR 3211 (5) and (7)l, to dismiss the complaint, in 
its entirety, on the grounds of res judicata and failure to state 
a cause of action and award 
This is an action for of costs. 
FACTS 
unpaid wages in violation of section 
190-199 of the Labor Law, breach of contract, breach of third-party 
beneficiary contract, unjust enrichment, conversion, and fraud. 
Plaintiffs are 13 former employees of defendant TUC. According to 
plaintiffs, their wages with TUC consisted of base salary, hourly 
wages, benefits (health and medical insurance), paid vacation days, 
sick days, and personal days. 
In a stipulation dated January 12, 2001, moving defendants 1 
agreed to withdraw that portion of their application to dismiss 
on the basis of lack of jurisdiction and on the condition that 
plaintiffs serve the corporation through service on the Secretary 
of State. 
1 [* 2 ]
In February 1993, defendant TUC, a catering firm, entered into 
a service agreement with defendant Bankers Trust Company ("Bankers 
Trust") to manage its executive dining room at 130 Liberty Street, 
New York N.Y. (the IIFood Service Contract") Pursuant to the Food 
Service Contract TUC, as operator, retained the right 
to exercise full control of and supervision over the 
performance of Operator's obligations hereunder, and full 
control over the employment, direction, compensation and 
discharge of all employees; that Operator will be solely 
responsible for all matters relating to the payment of 
such employees including compliance with workers' 
compensation insurance, unemployment and disability 
insurance, Social Security, withholding taxes and all 
other Federal and State Laws. 
(Food Service Contract, § 4.01). Bankers Trust also agreed that, 
in the event of the termination of the Food Service Contract, it 
would promptly pay "all supplier bills, payroll, taxes, fringe 
benefits and other costs due" (Food Service Contract, § 9.03). 
Upon the execution of the Food Service Contract, TUC agreed to 
assign cooks, waiters and managers to work at the bank. TUC 
assigned each of the plaintiffs to work in Bankers Trust's 
Executive Dining Room. The original term of the Food Service 
Contract was for a three-year period, commencing February 1993 and 
Terminating January 1996. 
This term was extended by letter agreements between the 
parties. The last letter agreement, which was dated March 1998, 
extended the contract for an additional three-year period. 
However, the March 1998 agreement included an amendment to section 
9 of the Food Service Contract provision which provided that the 
agreement 
2 [* 3 ]
may be terminated at any time during such term by either 
party for any reason upon sixty (60) days prior written 
notice to the other party, or by the Firm pursuant to 
Section 6.06 (which provides for immediate termination 
for unsafe food management). 
In March 1999, Bankers Trust was purchased by defendant 
Deutsche Bank. TUC's president, Mr. Fehlig, was advised by 
officers of Deutsche Bank that his company's services were no 
longer required and that Deutsche Bank wanted to terminate the Food 
Service Contract. Deutsche Bank offered to pay TUC's management 
fee for two months. 
Mr. Fehlig stated that TUC would acceptethe conversation as 
However, Mr. Fehlig rejected Deutsche a 60-day termination notice. 
Bank's offer to pay only management fees as insufficient, under the 
terms of the Food Service Contract 
On March 26, 1999, TUC and the defendant banks reached a 
settlement which provided that 
Bankers Trust agrees to pay The Upper Crust a two month 
management fee in the amount of sixteen thousand, six 
hundred and sixty-six dollars and sixty-six cents 
($16,666.66) in lieu of the sixty day termination notice. 
Additionally, Bankers Trust agrees to pay to the Upper 
Crust the sum equal to 60 days of full-time salaries, 
wages, and applicable benefits. Also, Bankers Trust will 
pay an additional one thousand dollars ($1,000) in out 
placement fees for each full-time employee. 
Upper Crust may invoice Bankers Trust for the amount set 
forth herein and Bankers Trust shall remit payment within 
14 days of receipt of such invoice. 
Mr. Fehlig states that he then tried to settle the labor cost 
issue with his employees by meeting in March 1999 with plaintiff 
James Lynch and Suzette Kaminski, who were the manager and the 
executive chef assigned to Bankers Executive Dinning Room. Mr. 
3 [* 4 ]
Fehlig offered to employ Mr. Lynch and Ms. Kaminski at TUC's new 
division, Simple Fare, at their present salaries of $48,519 and 
$52,000, respectively. According to Mr. Fehlig, all other 
employees who had been assigned to the Executive Dinning Room, 
including secondary managers, waiters, cooks and dishwashers, would 
be paid at a set rate. Secondary managers which were salaried, 
plaintiff Sara Lei (Sous Chef) and Richard Hawk (Assistant Manager) 
would receive three weeks salary. All hourly employees would 
receive two weeks wages. All employees would receive continued 
health coverage up to May 1, 1999. TUC would not enforce the 
clause in the contract with Bankers Trust which precluded the bank 
from hiring any of TUC's former staff. TUC also offered out- 
placement counseling to its employees. 
According to Mr. Fehlig, Bankers eventually agreed to pay TUC 
an additional $175,644.52, to allegedly compensate the caterer for 
monetary and other "intangible losses. I' On April 30, 199TTUC 
submitted two invoices to Bankers Trust which totaled $175,644.52. 
TUC's invoice clearly stated that the 60-day payroll for the 
Executive Dining Room totaled $111,394.80. Health insurance and 
disability costs were also based on two-month period. 
The moving defendants maintain that, on May 14, 1999, TUC 
received a payment of $121,576.25 from the Bankers Trust. Along 
with its payment, Bankers Trust allegedly submitted a letter to TUC 
outlining discrepancies between the parties' agreement and actual 
labor costs: 
Enclosed you will find a check in the amount of 
$121,576.25, representing the final payment between The 
4 [* 5 ]
Upper Crust and Bankers Trust Company. 
I have attached a copy of your invoice with handwritten 
changes which reflect the revised amount. The revisions 
were based on the following; 
+ The intent of the agreement was to provide your staff 
two months (sixty calendar days or eight weeks) of 
salaries and wages and applicable benefits. Your invoice 
reflects sixty working days. 
+Your waitstaff standard schedules were based on a 
thirty five hour work week. Therefore, their daily wages 
should have been calculated on a seven hour day instead 
of eight. 
+ One of your servers, John Hightower, [&I wage was 
listed as $16.10 per hour. According to your payroll 
register, his hourly wage was $15.60. 
+Tom Humphrey was included on your payroll listing. 
Your records indicate he was a part-time employee, and 
therefore ineligible for compensation or out placement 
service. 
+You included a $7.60 charge for insurance premium cost, 
on the Advanced Technologies Inc. invoice. This charge 
was removed. 
Although TUC disputed the sum paid, no further monies were received 
from the bank. The statements in May 1999 letter, which was 
allegedly issued by an employee of Bankers Trust, are the basis of 
plaintiffs' claim that they are entitled to receive 60-days salary 
and benefits from TUC. 
Moving defendants maintains that TUC never agreed to pay 60- 
days' wages to its employees and there is no company policy which 
entitles TUC's employees to receive unused sick days or personal 
days upon separation from the company. According to TUC, any 
vacations days that had been accrued by plaintiffs at the time of 
their separation were fully compensated for by the company when it 
gave each plaintiff two to three weeks pay in April 1999. Mr. 
5 [* 6 ]
Fehlig also alleges that the terms of his actual agreement with 
Bankers Trust do not comport with the statements made in the letter 
dated May 14, 1999. Furthermore, Mr. Fehlig avers that he called 
Elliot Cohen, the person with whom he conducted the final 
negotiations regarding the settlement of the Food Service Contract 
(Fehlig 11/17/2000 Aff, at 2, f 3). Mr. Fehlig states that during 
that conversion, Mr Cohen advised that 
(1) he has no memory of the substance of our meeting; (2) 
he cannot confirm that it is his signature that appears 
on the letter annexed to plaintiffs' papers as Exhibit I; 
and (3) he cannot confirm that he even authored the 
letter. I raised the issue of the letter's authenticity 
with Mr. Cohen because the letter did not contain the 
actual terms of our agreement and because other TUC 
letters received from Mr. Cohen while he was employed at 
Bankers Trust were written on his personal stationary 
DISCUSSION 
Res Judicata 
The instance action is not barred by virtue of Mr. Lynch's 
June 1999 proceeding in Small Claims Court which sought an award of 
$2,797.39 for the 12 vacation days earned in 1998 since the New 
York City Civil Court Act specifically provides that a small claims 
judgment "'may be pleaded as res judicata only as to the amount 
involved in the [small claim] and shall not otherwise be deemed an 
adjudication of any fact at issue or found therein in any other 
action or court" (Purnavel v Tel-A-Car of New York, Inc., 204 AD2d 
297 [2d Dept 19941 , quoting CCA 1808). TUC has also failed to show 
that the issues presently before this Court were determined in the 
prior proceeding before the small claims court since all claims in 
b [* 7 ]
the case at bar concern wages and benefits allegedly owed by TI@ in 
1999 (Lukowsky v Shalit, 110 AD2d 563, 566 [lst Dept 19851, citing 
Reilly v Reid, 45 NY2d 24, 27 [19781). 
Therefore, that branch of the motion of TUC and Mr. Fehlig to 
dismiss the complaint on the ground of res judicata is denied. 
Contract Claims 
Absent a written or otherwise concrete expression of the 
duration, terms, and conditions of employment such as, for example, 
a collective bargaining agreement, all employment in New York is 
deemed to be at will, terminable for whatever reason, by either 
employee or employer (De Soiza v Unz & Co., NYLJ 8/12/99 at 22, 
c012 [Sup Ct, NY County 19991 , citing Sabetav v Sterlinq Druq, Inc. 
69 NY2d 329 [1987] [remaining citations omitted]). 
Vague oral assurances are insufficient to overcome the 
presumption that employment is terminable at will (Ullmann v Norma 
Kamali, Inc., 207 AD2d 691, 692 [lst Dept 19941). 
The record does not indicate that plaintiffs were subject to 
a collective bargaining agreement or had a contractual right to be 
employed for 60 days after the termination of the Food Service 
Contract. It is clear that plaintiffs were not signatories to the 
agreements between the banks and TUC. The Food Service Contract 
only required that Bankers Trust pay TUC's payroll invoices upon 
termination. There was no written guarantee that a particular 
employee would receive 60 days pay regardless of the fact of 
whether he or she worked during the notice period. Therefore, 
plaintiffs, as at-will employees, cannot allege that they were 
7 [* 8 ]
prematurely terminated from their job assignment at Bankers Trust's 
Executive Dining Room (De Soiza v Unz & Co., supra, NYLJ 8/12/99). 
Therefore, the second cause of action for breach of contract fails. 
However, mere lack of privity does not automatically preclude 
relief since it is long established in New York that a third party 
may sue as a beneficiary on a contract made for his or her benefit 
(Port Chester Elec. Constr. Corp. v Atlas, 40 NY2d 652, 655 
[19761). In order for plaintiffs to assert rights as third-party 
beneficiaries, they must establish the existence of a valid and 
binding contract between other parties, that the contract was 
intended for their benefit and (3) that the benefit to them is 
sufficiently immediate, rather than incidental, to indicate the 
assumption by the contracting parties of a duty to compensate them 
if the benefit is lost (State of California Pub. Employs. 
Retirement Sys. v Shearman & Sterlinq, 95 NY2d 427, 435 [20001). 
It is clear that TUC and Bankers Trust/Deutsche Bank entered 
into a settlement to satisfy the latter's failure to give TUC a 60- 
day service cancellation notice. However, in order for plaintiffs 
to sustain a claim that they were the intended beneficiaries of the 
settlement of the Food Service Contract, they must state sufficient 
facts which show that Illperformance of the promise will satisfy an 
obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary' or that 
'the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the 
beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance I 'I (Fourth Ocean 
Putnam CorD. v Interstate Wreckinq Co., Inc., 66 NY2d 38, 44 
[1985]). The fact that Bankers Trust/Deutsche Bank agreed to pay 
8 [* 9 ]
TUC for up to two months of salary for each of the caterer's 
employees does not make every employee an intended beneficiary of 
the settlement agreement (cf. Rekis v Lake Minnewaska Mountain 
Houses, Inc., 170 AD2d 124, 128-129 [3d Dept 19911, appeal 
dismissed 79 NY2d 851, rearq denied 79 NY2d 978 [19921). Rather, 
the bank's promise to pay was intended as a means to reimburse TUC 
for expenses incurred during what would have been the 60-day notice 
period. The terms of the Food Service Contract clearly shows that 
plaintiffs would have no right to look to either Bankers Trust or 
its successor, Deutsche Bank, for payment of their wages in the 
event that the bank breached its contract with TUC. Furthermore, 
the settlement letters submitted on this application did not modify 
the employment relationship between plaintiffs and TUC. As the 
employer, TUC would still be liable for any unpaid wages or 
benefits for time actually worked by an employee. Therefore, the 
third cause of action for breach of contract under a third-party 
beneficiary theory fails. 
Waqe Claims 
In their first cause of action plaintiffs allege that 
defendants violated sections 191(1) , 191(3) and 198 of the Labor 
Law by failing to compensate them for 60 days salary and benefits 
as well as outplacement services and for all accrued and unused 
vacation days, sick days and personal days. 
In New York, the term 'Iwages" is broadly defined as "the 
earnings of an employee for labor or services rendered, regardless 
of whether the amount of earnings iqdetermined on a time, piece, 
9 [* 10 ]
commission or other basis" (Labor Law § 190[11). Wages in this 
State include "benefits or wage supplements" (ibid.) which is 
defined by statute to include "reimbursement for expenses; health, 
welfare and retirement benefits; and vacation, separation or 
holiday pay" (Labor Law 5 198-c [2] ) . In New York, non discretionary 
payments are generally considered wages (Westheim v Elkay Indus., 
166 AD2d 318 [lst Dept 19901). Therefore, mandatory severance pay 
is within the definition of wages found in section 190(1) of the 
Labor Law (De Soiza v Unz & Co., supra, NYLJ 8/12/99, citing 
Tischmann v ITT/Sheraton Corp., 882 F Supp 1358, 1369 [SD NY 19951 
[remaining citation omitted]). Unearned future payments, however, 
are not wages under the statute (see, Tuttle v Geo. McOuesten Co., 
Inc., 227 AD2d 754, 756 [3d Dept 19961). 
Contrary to TUe's allegations, plaintiffs fall with& the 
category of workers protected by statute. New York State permits 
all employees, even those in managerial positions, to bring wage 
claims against employers who violate the provisions of the Labor 
Law (Labor Law § 191; 198 [l]) . Furthermore, nothing in the statute 
bars at-will employees for bringing claims for improperly withheld 
wages or benefits (see., Epelbaum v Nefesh Achath B'Yisrel, Inc., 
237 AD2d 327, 328-239 [2d Dept 19971). The limitation found in 
section 198-c(3) of the Labor Law2 does not apply to the present 
claim since this provision applies only to section 198-c which 
Section 198-c(3) of the Labor Law provides, in pertinent 
part, II[t]his section shall not apply to any person in a bona 
fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity whose 
earnings are in excess of six hundred dollars a week." 2 
10 [* 11 ]
makes it a misdemeanor for persons or corporate entities to 
withhold benefits or wage supplements (Labor Law § 198 [ll ; De Soiza 
v Unz & Co., supra, NYLJ 8/12/99). 
However, in order for plaintiffs to assert a valid claim for 
wages and/or wage supplements, they must plead sufficient facts to 
show that they have an enforceable contractual right to those wages 
and benefits (Tiernev v Capricorn Investors, L.P., 189 AD2d 629, 
632 [lst Dept], appeal denied 81 NY2d 710 119931). In this 
instance, TUC never required plaintiffs to work an additional 60 
days after the termination of the service contract or specifically 
informed the workers that they would be entitled to 60 days of 
severance pay. Since there is no indication that any of the 
plaintiffs actually worked for TUC or the defendant banks during 
the 60-day period, they have not raised a viable claim for unpaid 
wages and benefits for the 60 day-notice period. 
In addition, plaintiffs have not stated sufficient facts to 
indicate that they were not fully compensated for work actually 
performed. Plaintiffs do not allege that TUC still owed them wages 
or vacation pay which accrued prior to the termination of the Food 
Service Contract. Hence, the present claim for violation of the 
wage provisions of the Labor Law is insufficient. 
Since plaintiffs have failed to show they are entitled to 
additional wages and related benefits, they are also not entitled 
to reasonable attorneys' fees, ordinary costs, and liquidated 
damages for willful withholding of wages due (Labor Law §§ 198E11 
and 198 [l-a]). 
11 [* 12 ]
Therefore, that branch of TUC's motion to dismiss the first 
cause of action for insufficiency is granted. 
Unjust Enrichment 
An entity is unjustly enriched if it receives property or 
money under circumstances that in equity and good conscience it 
ought not to retain (Simonds v Simonds, 45 NY2d 233, 242 [19781). 
Here, plaintiffs have not stated sufficient facts which indicate 
that they bestowed a benefit to TUC or to the defendant banks and 
that their employer failed to adequately compensate them (Tarrvtown 
House Condominiums, Inc. v Hainie, 161 AD2d 310, 313 [lst Dept 
19903). The fact that TUC did not employ all of the plaintiffs for 
the full 60-day period does not give plaintiffs, at will employees, 
a right to relief. Any right to receive a reimbursement for a?# 
discrepancy in the invoices presented to the settling banks, may 
only be enforced by Bankers Trust or Deutsche Bank. Plaintiffs do 
not have a right to claim a portion of the alleged overpayment or 
to be paid salary or benefits for time which they did not actually 
work (see, Heller v Kurz, 228 AD2d 263, 265 [lst Dept 19961. 
Therefore, TUC's motion to dismiss the fourth cause of action is 
granted. 
Conversion and Fraud 
Since plaintiffs do not plead sufficient facts to show that 
they had a legal right to the sums paid by Bankers Trust to TUC as 
a settlement of the Food Service Contract, plaintiffs' fifth cause 
of action for conversion also fails (Ahles v Aztec Enters., Inc. 
120 AD2d 903 [3d Dept], Iv denied 68 NY2d 611 [19861). 
12 [* 13 ]
In order to sustain their sixth cause of action for fraud, 
plaintiff must allege more than mere promissory statementj about 
what is to be done in the future; they must allege some 
9,isstatement of material fact or promises with a present , albeit 
undisclosed intent not to perform them (Shlanq v Bear's Estates 
ilevelopment of Smallwood, N.Y., Inc., 194 AD2d 914, 915-916 [3d 
Dept. 19931). The pleading do not state that TUC misrepresented 
the status of their Food Service contract (cf., Gabriel v 
Therapists Unlimited, L.P., 218 AD2d 514, 616 [lst Dept 19951). 
Moreover, general allegations that defendants entered into a 
contract while lacking the intent to perform it are insufficient to 
suppcrt a separate fraud claim (New York University v Continental 
Ins. Co., 87 NY2d 308, 318 [1995]). The sixth cause of action is 
also legally unsupportable because, as at will employees, 
Flaintiffs may not claim justifiable reliance since they had no 
right to expect that TUC would continue to employ them after 
Deutsche Bank terminated the Food Service Contract (Montchal v 
Northeast Sav. Bank, 243 AD2d 452 [2d Dept 19971). 
Since the court has dismissed all of causes of action, 
plaintiffs claim for punitive damages also fails 
Accordingly, it is 
3RDERED that defendants' motion to dismiss for insufficiency 
is granted and the complaint is dismissed, in its entirety, with 
costs and disbursements to defendants as taxed by the Clerk of the 
Court; and it is further
