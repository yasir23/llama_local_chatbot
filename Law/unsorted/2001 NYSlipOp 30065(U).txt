DECISION & ORDER 
“They have mouths, but speak not, eyes that see not, ears that hear not.” - Psalm 115 
Duty (of reasonable disclosure), unlike beauty, is not in the eye of the beholder but the 
mouths, eyes and ears of a reasonably informed and informative surgeon and patient. 
Defendant’s, NORMAN H. 
SCHULMAN, MD, CPLR 
0 4404(a) motion to set aside the 
unanimous jury verdict, in the sum of $2,150,000.00 is denied for the hereinbelow stated reasons. 
A. ISSUES 
1. Actionable 
Whether defendant plastic surgeon was a reasonably informed and patiently informative 
intermediarv, to a reasonably prudent patient, such as, plaintiff, JAMA RUSSANO, of new 
developments, positive and negative in the field at subject surgery to have informed consent? An 
issue of first conception and application on the issue of informed consent! 
1 [* 1]
2. 
Evidentiarv 
Whether there was sufficient competent evidence presented during trial to support the 
verdict that the defendant, NORMAN SCHULMAN, MD, committed malpractice and failed to 
obtain informed consent in excising thirteen (13) axillary lymph nodes; removing a cyst from 
behind the plaintiffs, JAMA RUSSANO, right nipple (malpractice only); performing the 
mastopexy of the left breast (informed consent only); and using another silicone breast implant? 
B. FACTS 
Plaintiff, JAMA RUSSANO, was born with a malformation of her right breast as well as a 
congenital hemangioma. The hemangioma and breast tissue were removed. In July, 1970, at age 
fourteen (14), plaintiff, JAMA RUSSANO, had her right breast reconstructed and a mammary 
prosthesis implanted. The prosthesis was a Dow Corning silastic silicone gel-filed breast implant. 
Approximately eleven (1 1) years later, plaintiff, JAMA RUSSANO, began experiencing 
various health problems and in 1989, was diagnosed with a Scleroderma -like syndrome. She was 
then referred to defendant, NORMAN 
 SCHCTLMAN, MD, a plastic surgeon, regarding her breast 
implant. On December 13, 1989, defendant, 
 NORMAN 
 SCHULMAN, MD, removed plaintiff, 
JAMA RUSSANO’s, old implant and inserted a new Dow Corning Silastic silicone gel-filled 
implant. At the same time, defendant, NORMAN 
 SCHULMAN, MD, also removed thirteen (13) 
lymph nodes from the axillary section of Ms. 
RU!SSANO’s right arm. Additionally, Dr. Schulman 
performed a mastopexy on her right breast. 
Following the implant exchanges, plaintiff; JAMA RUSSANO’s, health problems 
continued to persist and worsen, yet there was no specific traceable etiology for her illnesses. [* 2]
Then in the early 1990’~~ there were reports that silicon breast implants may cause immunological 
malfunctions, similar to those experienced by Mrs. RUSSANO. Suspecting that her health 
problems may be so related to her implant, in December 1991, plaintiff, JAMA RUSSANO, had 
the silicon implant removed. Ultimately, in October, 1991, plaintiff, JAMA RUSSANO, had 
reconstructive surgery whereby a portion of her right latisimus dorsi muscle was used to create a 
right breast. The surgery was performed by Dr. Shaw of the UCLA Medical Center in California. 
C. PARTIES’ CONTENTIONS 
Defendant contends the jury verdict should be set aside, under CPLR 
 9 4404(a), for six 
reasons. First, defendant declares the jury verdict is not supported by the evidence adduced at 
trial. Second, defendant contends the claim of malpractice submitted to the jury on the Jury 
Interrogatory (Ct. Ex. 9) has no causal nexus with the injuries alleged. Third, defendant argues 
there was insufficient evidence that the plaintiff suffered the alleged injuries. Fourth, defendant 
submits the jury verdict is against the weight of a fair interpretation of the credible evidence. 
Fifth, defendant claims the Court made erroneous charges and rulings which tainted the verdict 
and were not harmless. Lastly, defendant disputes the jury’s award deviated materially from 
reasonable compensation. 
In opposition, plaintiffs contend the jury verdict was supported by both fact and expert 
evidence adduced at trial and not against the weight of a fair interpretation of the credible 
evidence. Plaintiffs submit that this Court made no error of law in the charge or in the 
introduction of evidence. Plaintiffs also declares the damages awarded by the jury were supported 
by the evidence and not excessive.

D. TRIAL 
This nine (9) day ended with a jury verdict for plaintiffs in the total sum of $2,150,000.00; 
$1,200,000.00 for past pain and suffering (December 13, 1989 to verdict), $800,000 for fbture 
pain and suffering (15 years) and $150,000 for spouse RICHARD Russano’s derivative suit for 
loss of services. 
At trial, plaintiffs brought the following witnesses: plaintiff, JAMA RUSSANO; plaintiff, 
RICHARD RUSSANO; expert pathologist, Dr. Douglas Shanklin; and expert plastic surgeon, Dr. 
Richard Mafiggi; and also called defendant on plaintiffs case. 
At trial, defendant presented the following witnesses: defendant, Dr. Norman Schulman; 
expert plastic surgeons, Dr. Jane Petro and Dr. Arthur Ship. 
E. ANALYSIS & FINDINGS 
1. Whether the iurv’s verdict is or is not 
sumorted by the evidenced adduced at 
trial. 
In order to set aside a jury verdict as against the weight of the credible evidence there 
must be “no valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences which could possibly lead rational 
men to the conclusion reached by the jury on the basis of the evidence presented at trial.” Cohen 
v. Hallmark, 45 NY 2d 493,410 NYS 2d 282,382 NE 2d 1145 (1978); Adamv v. Zinakus, 92 
NY2d 396,681 NYS2d 463,704 NE2d 216 (1998). 
Whether a jury verdict is against the weight of the evidence is essentially a discretionary 
and factual determination which must be exercised with considerable caution based upon the 
absence of substantial justice, not simply an unsatisfactory verdict or one which the Court 
4 [* 4]
disagrees. Cohen v. Hallmark; suura; Nicastro v. Park, 1 13 AD 2d 129, 495 NYS 2d 184 
(2nd 
Dept. 1985). 
In this matter, both sides presented expert testimony which differed as to the necessity of 
and consent to removing the axillary mass including the thirteen (13) lymph nodes and the cyst 
behind the left nipple, the medical appropriateness of and consent to using silicone breast 
implants, as well as, consent to the mastopexy. Both sides adduced testimony as to the plaintiffs 
medical history before and after Dr. Schulman’s surgery. Each side presented testimonial 
evidence in a manner most beneficial to their position on the risks and benefits of the various 
surgical procedures performed on plaintiff, JAMA RUSSANO, as well as the manner in which 
informed consent to each phase of the surgery was obtained. Accordingly, the issues of medical 
malpractice and informed consent were questions of fact for the jury to decide. Thus, this Court 
may not overturn that verdict because the defendant has failed to show there was “no valid line of 
reasoning and permissible inferences which could possibly lead rational men to the conclusion 
reached by the jury on the evidence presented at trial.” Cohen v. Hallmark, suura. 
2. Medical 
 Mabractice 
To prevail on a malpractice action, plaintiff must show that there was a 
deviation(s) of the 
average Board certified plastic surgeon in good standing or 
departure(s) from accepted medical 
practice of the average Board certified plastic surgeon in good standing in New York County, and 
evidence that such 
 departure(s) was a proximate cause of injury or damage. Spensieri v. Lash, 94 
NY 2d 23 1,701 NYS 2d 689,723 NE 2d 5444 (1999); De Stefan0 v. Immerman, 188 AD 2d 
448, 591 NYS 2d 47 
(2nd Dept. 1992 ); Amsler v. Verilli, 119 AD 2d 786, 501 NYS 2d 41 1 
(2”d 
Dept. 1986). The law normally permits the medical profession to establish its own standard of 
5 [* 5]
care so that evidence a physician conformed to accepted community standards of practice usually 
insulates the doctor from tort liability. Beason v. Dean, 232 NY 52, 133 NE 125 (1921); Prosser 
& Keeton, The Law Torts [Sth Ed] $32 - The Reasonable Person p. 185 (1984) A second 
principle based on the reasonable man applies in a medical malpractice case. Such requires that a 
physician use his best judgment and whatever superior knowledge, skill and intelligence possessed 
so that the specialist may be held to a higher standard than the general practitioner. Toth v. 
Community Hospital at Glenn Cove, 22 NY 2d 255,263,292 NYS 2 440,447,239 NE 2d 368, 
372-3 (1968); Restatement 2d, Torts 
 9 2994 (2000) comment c. Annot: Zitter, Jay, Standard of 
Care Owed to patient by Medical Specialist as Determined by Local, “Like Community,” State, 
National or Other Standards, 18 ALR 
 4& 603 (2001). 
a. Removal of the axillarv mass containing thirteen lymsh nodes. 
At trial plaintiffs pathology expert, Dr. Shanklin testified the removal of the axillary tissue 
containing the thirteen (13) lymph nodes was not within the standard of care in New York City 
and County in 1989. (TT 30:13 - 3 1:23; 41:7 - 42:12). Similarly, plaintiffs plastic surgery 
expert Dr. 
Mafiggi testified that the mass removed was a dissection, not a biopsy, and that “the 
standard was to take the least amount of tissue that would give a diagnosis ...[ a] frozen section 
would be what I consider standard.” (TT 34:2 - 24; 38:s - 39:20) Furthermore, Dr. Shanklin 
testified the injuries sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the aforementioned departure include 
“acute lymphedema” and “swelling of her right arm and under her arm, restriction of movements 
and pain” which are “the long-term consequences of all those lymph channels by removing 13 
nodes.”(TT 53:7 - 15; 54:21 - 55:4) 
6 [* 6]
b. Removal of cyst from behind left nipple. 
At trial, plaintiffs pathology expert, Dr. Shanklin testified that a reasonable surgeon who 
encountered a visually undiseased cyst during elective surgery, such as a mastopexy, would 
aspirate, not remove, the cyst. (TT 94:23 - 95:9; 96: 17 - 96:24) Dr. Shanklin, after having stated 
that it was not necessary to remove the cyst testified that in doing so the plaintiff is injured by 
scarring. (TT 97:s - 97: 1 1) Dr. 
Mafiggi also testified that the decreased nipple sensation 
complained of by plaintiff could be the result of the mastopexy or the cyst removal. (TT 5 1 :5 - 
51:19) 
c. Using silicone breast implants. 
In the 1980’s general concern evolved over a potential negative relationship between 
silicon gel breast implants and immunological disorders. Dr. 
Mafiggi testified that the source of 
his knowledge regarding the controversy ever silicone gel breast and immunological disease came 
from discussion at professional meeting, peer reviewed medical journals and the manufacturers 
themselves. (TT 19: 14 - 19:24) According to Dr. 
Mafiggi’s testimony, “at least one 
(manufacturer) that I know of actually put it in their insert, the instruction sheet ... that comes with 
the implant, and suggested that it was certainly a reason for concern.” (TT 19:20 - 19:24) That 
manufacturer, Dr. 
Mafiggi testified, was Dow-Corning. (TT 20:3) In light of the suspicion and 
manufacturer concur, Dr. 
Mafiggi testified that the appropriate care for a patient such as JAMA 
RUSSANO, in 1989, by a reasonable plastic surgeon would be to delay, “‘We think that there 
might be a connection [between silicone and Scleroderma]. The recommendation is that you have 
that [the old silicone implant) removed until we know that it’s safe to put it back in or put 
something else back in.”’ (TT 21 :5 - 23:20) Thus, as per Dr. 
Marfbggi, the standard for 
7 [* 7]
individuals presenting with medical concerns like JAMA RUSSANO, was to remove the 
implant(s) and monitor the patient to see if there was an improvement in the condition about 
which the patient was concerned. (TT 23:lO - 23:20) The injuries sustained by plaintiff as a result 
of Dr. 
SCHULMAN’s actions, according to Dr. 
Marhggi, were additional surgery to remove the 
implants, scarring and possible relation or exacerbation of Ms. RUSSANO’s immunological 
problems. Dr. Shanklin added slippage of the implant to the list of injuries sustained by plaintiff 
3. Lack of Informed Consent 
a. Lack of informed consent to removal of the axillarv mass 
 containiw 
thirteen lvmDh nodes. 
In 1914, Mr. Justice Cardozo of the New York Court of Appeals held that a surgeon who 
performed an operation without a patient’s consent committed an assault and battery. 
SchloendorfFv. Societv 
 ofNYHoso., 211 NY 125, 105 NE 92 (1914); see also, Darrah v. Kite, 
32 AD2d 208,301 NYS 2d 286 
(3d Dept - 1969); Pearl v. Lesnick, 20 AD2d 761,247 NYS 2d 
561, affd 19 NY2d 590,278 NYS 2d 237,224 NE 2d 739 (1967); 
 McCandless v. State ofNew 
-7 York 3 AD2d 600,162 NYS 2d 570 
(3rd Dept - 1957) This concept has been consistently upheld, 
although today, the concept is codified and characterized as a lack of informed consent, more 
closely akin to malpractice, than battery which requires mens rea. Public Health Law (PHL) 
0 
2805 -d; Murriello v. Crapotta, 5 1 AD 2d 381, 382 NYS 2d 513 
(2”d Dept - 1976). The transition 
from battery to lack of informed consent is grounded in a patient’s right to self determination and 
complementary duty of a physician to disclose the risks, choices and potential dangers of a given 
medical procedure. Lipsius v. White, 91 AD 2d 271, 458 NYS 2d 928 
(2”d Dept - 1983). 
Statutorily, then, lack of informed consent is: 
8 [* 8]
the failure of the person providing the professional treatment or 
diagnosis to disclose to the patient such alternatives thereto and 
the reasonably foreseeable risks and benefits involved as a reasonable 
medical.. .practitioner under similar circumstances would have 
disclosed, in a manner permitting the patient to make a knowledgeable 
evaluation.”PHL $ 2805-d( 1). 
I\ 
To have a cause of action for lack of informed consent, 
‘’ it must also be established that a reasonably prudent person in the 
patient’s position would not have undergone the treatment or 
diagnosis if he had been hlly informed and that the lack of informed 
consent is a proximate cause of the injury or condition for which 
recovery is 
sought!’PHL $ 
2805-d(3) 
Nothing in Public Health Law 
 $2805-d( l), nor in the 
applicable case law suggests that elective 
cosmetic surgery is subject to a less stringent disclosure standard. Lee-Lu Pan v. Shaw, 203 
AD2d 61 1, 195 NYS2d 158 (l** Dept. 1994). To prevail on a lack of informed consent claim 
plaintiff must show: 1) the treating physician failed to disclose to the patient the material risks, 
benefits and alternatives of the procedure, 2) a reasonably prudent patient would not have 
undergone the procedure if such information were disclosed, and 3) this failure to disclose 
information is a proximate cause of the patient’s injury. PHL $5 
2805-d(1) and (3); Alberti v. St. 
John’s 
 EPiscopal 
 Hostital-Smithtown, 116 AD 2d 612, 497 NYS 2d 701 
(2”d Dept. 1986) 
The level of disclosure required is what “a reasonable medical.. .practitioner (i.e. Board 
Certified Plastic Surgeon) under similar circumstances would have disclosed,” PHL $ 2805-d( l), 
and must cover (1) the alternatives, (2) the reasonably foreseeable risks and (3) the benefits, 
Marchione v. State, 194 AD 2d 851, 598 NYS 2d 592 
(3rd Dept. 1993) and the lack of informed 
consent must be a proximate cause of the injury. PHL $ 
28O5-d( 1) 
The “learned intermediary’’ doctrine was first enunciated by the New York Court of 
9 [* 9]
Appeals in Martin v. Hacker, 83 NY 2d 1,607 NYS 2d 598,628 NE 2d 1308 (1993) which 
focused on a drug manufacturer’s duty to warn of the dangers of using the drug in question, 
which is hlfilled by giving adequate warning to the prescribing physician. The physician must 
then balance the risks and benefits of the various drugs and treatments and act as an “informed 
intermediarv” between manufacturer and patient in malpractice cases. Martin v. Hacker, 83 NY 
2d suura at 9. The Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) applicable page(s) is admissible 
 not as a 
hearsay exception to prima facie estabIish the standard of care (or professional negligence) in 
medical malpractice cases since New York rejects the Minnesota “Mulder rule” (Mulder v. Park 
Davis & Co., 288 Minn. 332, 181 W2d 882,45 ALR2d 920 [1970J) but solely to establish the 
existence of a warning and its adequacv to a uhvsician. Suensieri v. Lash, supra at 239. 
There appears no distinguishable basis in 
fairness,reasonable reliance or 
professional responsibility why the “informed intermediary doctrine” applied in a medical 
malpractice case should not apply to risk disclosure in a lack of informed consent action 
based upon the same principle that a patient has a right to determine what shall be done 
with her (or his) 
body,qqdy. 
 Schoendorffv. Societv of New York Hosp., 21 1 NY 125, 105 
NE 920 (1914); Zeleznik v. Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital, 47 AD 2d 199, 366 NYS 2d 163 
(2nd Dept - 1975); Waltz & Schneurman: Informed Consent to Therapv 64 NWUL Rev 628,647 
(1 993) 
The physician’s obligation is to make reasonable disclosure of the available choices and 
potential dangers to the patient and the test of such reasonableness is for the jury to decide. Fogal 
v. Genesee Hosp., 41 AD 2d 468,344 NYS 552 (4* Dept - 1973); Canterbury v. Spence, 464 F 
2d 772 @C Cir - 1972). In Canterburv, the Court held that the duty and required scope of 
10 [* 10]
disclosure standards in the medical profession must be established by expert medical testimony but 
”tested by general 
- considerations of reasonable disclosure under all the circumstances will 
materially affect the patient’s decision to proceed with the treatment. (emphasis added) This is 
not 
a retrospective determination. There should be no criticism of the physician unless the fact-finder 
determines that the information was 
inadequate.”Canterburv v. Spence, 464 F 2d supra at 787. 
Consideration of the patient’s veracity shifts the focus from the time relevant to causation; the 
time juncture at which her (or his) consent was given. Waltz & Schneurman supra at 646. The 
proper rule is to resolve the causality issue on an objective basis; i.e. what a reasonably prudent 
person in the patient’s circumstances would have decided if reasonably informed of the significant 
perils. The patient’s testimony is relevant, but not determinative. Canterburv v. Spence, 464 F 2d 
supra at 790. 
Thus, this Court properly allowed testimony by both defendant, Dr. NORMAN 
SCHULMAN, and plaintiffs medical expert, Dr. Richard 
 Mafiggi, about the 1985 
manufacturer’s insert reference to reports of suspected immunological sensitization from silicon 
breast implants to a person with past history, including plaintiff, of scleroderma and 
immunological problems. 
‘ Nowhere in the record does Dr. SCHULMAN claim to have informed the patient of the 
material risks, benefits or alternatives of removing thirteen (13) lymph nodes from the axilla under 
Mrs. RUSSANO’s right arm. Rather, by his own admission he did not intend to nor initially 
know that he had removed thirteen (13) lymph nodes. (TT 785) Dr. SCHULMAN 
acknowledges there was a “scar tissue lump” (TT 44:6-7) in the area which he “never for a 
moment thought might be cancerous” (TT 44: 12) otherwise he “wouldn’t have done plastic [* 11]
surgery.” (TT44: 15- 16) Dr. SCHULMAN was apparently so unconcerned about this lump that 
there is no mention of it in Mrs. RUSSANO’s chart on November 9’ or 16’ at which time Dr. 
SCHULMAN had examined Mrs. RUSSANO both visually and tacitly. (TT 44: 18-20) The first 
mention of the under arm excised lump is found in a clinical history and summary Dr. 
SCHULMAN was asked to produce for the RUSSANOS’ insurance company. 
Given some of the potential risks to removing thirteen (13) 
lymp%des such as, slippage 
of the breast implant, right arm swelling, and increased potential for lymphedema, and that an 
alternative to removing thirteen (13) lymphnodes would be to biopsy only one (1) or two (2) 
nodes because in DR. 
 SCHULMAN’s own words “lymph nodes are lymph nodes and one node 
may be representative of the rest of the body,” and that he felt only a benign “scar tissue 
lump,”(TT:2-4) it is believable that a reasonably prudent patient in the plaintiffs position with the 
aforementioned appropriate information would not have undergone the surgery. This analysis is 
also supported by the unanimous jury verdict declaring DR. SCHULMAN did not have informed 
consent to remove thirteen (13) lymphnodes. Furthermore, there was credible expert medical 
testimony that the removal of thirteen (13) lymphnodes can cause swelling, lymphedema and 
make a woman more susceptible to breast cancer. 
 (SC€€ULMAN TT 135-146) Plaintiff, JAMA 
RUSSANO, had swelling beyond what was to be expected, developed lymphedema and her right 
implant repeatedly slipped into the empty space created by the removal of the lymphnode mass. 
By DR. 
 SCHULMAN’s own admission he did .not plan to remove a mass, containing 
thirteen (1 3) lymph nodes, and any biopsy he may have contemplated doing was to be of only one 
lymph node. It is reasonable that a reasonably prudent 
have had the surgery if she had known all the risks and patient in the plaintiffs position would not 
alternatives, and medical testimony 
12 [* 12]
revealed the removal of the lymphnode mass was a proximate cause of plaintiff, JAMA 
RUSSANO's, injuries. Thus, taking Dr. 
SCHuLMAN's testimony as true he could not possibly 
informed consent to a procedure he did not intend to perform and is not exempted from 
needing to obtain informed consent because the surgery was not of an emergency nature. PHL 
 5 
2805-d(2); Connellv v. Warner, 248 AD 2d 941,670 NYS 2d 293 (4" Dept. 1998). 
b. Lack of informed consent to mastoDexv of the ripht breast and usinp 
another silicone breast imDlant. 
Plaintiffs right breast was perfectly healthy, yet defendant performed a mastopexy for 
cosmetic conformity with her left breast without any prior discussion with, much less choice of, 
the plaintiff about what shall be done with a sensitive part of her body. Schoendorfv. Society of 
New York Hospital, supra. As noted above, there is nothing in Public Health Law 
 §2805-d( l), 
nor in the applicable case law suggests that elective cosmetic surgery is subject to a less stringent 
disclosure standard. Lee-Lu Pan v. Shaw, 203 AD2d 61 1, 195 NYS2d 158 (lst Dept. 1994). 
3. Loss of Services and Society of Plaintiff RICHARD RUSSANO 
The jury verdict in the sum of $1 50,000.00 rendered in favor of plaintiff spouse, 
RICHARD RUSSANO, for loss of services and society of plaintiff, JAMA RUSSANO, based on 
plaintiffs testimony of their close relationship was fair, reasonable and amply supported by the 
trial evidence. Cohen v. Hallmark, supra. 
13 [* 13]
F. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons the verdict in favor of the plaintiff. $1,200,000.00 for past pain 
and suffering 
 (12/13/89 to date), $800,000 for future pain and suffering (15 years) and $150,000 
awarded to spouse RICHARD RUSSANO for his derivative suit is upheld; defendant, NOW 
H. SCHULMAN, M.D.'s CPLR 
 $4404(a) motion to set aside the verdict is denied and plaintiffs 
are entitled to and the Clerk is directed to enter judgment in accordance with the foregoing 
Decision and Order.
