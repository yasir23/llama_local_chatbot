By order, entered on July 25, 1994, this Court (Beverly 5. Cohen,

brought several proceedings in Housing Court seeking pcssession. 
Sec,Lrity Pacific eventually ojtainea a warrant of eviction against Its. 
Evars and subteriant Steven O‘Keefe, and the eviction was scheduled for 
Octaber 7, 1999. [* 3]

Secxrity Pacific now seeks to reargue the prior motion to vacate, 
assertin? that the Court clearly misapprehended =he circumsfances 
regarding the r,erger. Security Pacific issentially argues that i: and 
Bank of America were one and the same extity, and tkzt it was a simple 
ovsrsighz and typographical error that plaintiff’s nar.e was not modified 
tc reflecr the merger.

--_ qzid issue was litigated betwein the same parties and decided. 
Azcordingly, the Housing Court has already determined that such a defect 
dzes not constitute fraud and thus this court is collaterally estopped 
from firding ocnerwisi (see, Kaufxan v. Eli Lillv and ComDany, 65 NY2d 
443 [19€5]).
