J. STANLEY SHAW, JOHN DOE LAW PARTNERS 
I-X, and SHAW, LICITRA, BOHNER, ESERNIO, 
SCHWARTZ & PFLUGER, P.C., 
Defendants . 
DIANE A. LEBEDEFF, J.: 
Defendants move to dismiss the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3016(b) as against 
John Doe Law Partners I-X, and pursuant to CPLR 321 l(a)(5) against all defendants to the 
extent the complaint is based on various specified occurrences. 
This action for fraud and an accounting springs from a series of investments made 
by plaintiff from 1986 to 1999 through defendant J. Stanley Shaw 
 ("Shaw"), an attorney 
and long-standing friend of 
plaintiflrs. As alleged by plaintiff, he invested large sums of 
money with Shaw in a series of complex loan-related transactions without questioning the 
particulars too closely because of his great trust in Shaw, who was his attorney as well as 
his friend. Several years ago, plaintiff began to ask questions because the investments were 
not yielding the rate of return he expected but received only deceptive answers from Shaw. 
He then began asking to see records of the various transactions, but his requests went 
mostly unheeded. Because of Shawls lack of candour and disclosure, plaintiff did not learn 
-1- [* 2 ]
of the fraud until March, 2000. This complaint, against Shaw, his firm and unspecified 
partners who may have assisted him in the fraud, was filed in February, 2001. 
Defendants now argue that any claims relating to transactions which occurred more 
than six years before the complaint was filed are 
time-barred by the applicable statute of 
limitations, and that all claims asserted against unnamed and unspecified partners must be 
dismissed as lacking the requisite particularity (CPLR 
 3016[b]). The court finds both 
arguments unpersuasive at this stage. 
At the outset, the court notes that this is a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 
321 1. "On a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 321 1, the pleading is to be afforded a 
liberal construction (see, CPLR 3026). We accept the facts as alleged in the 
cornplaint as 
true, accord plaintiffs the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only 
whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory " (Leon v. 
Marfinez, 84 
N.Y.2d 83, 87-88 [1994]). This same standard applies to motions pursuant to CPLR 
321 l(a)[5] (Gingold v. Beekman; 183 A.D.2d 870 [2d Dept. 19921). Plaintiffs affidavit 
may be considered to supplement the allegations in the complaint 
 (LeBeau v. Hulse, 280 
A.D.2d 649 [2d Dept. 20011; see ButZer v. 
Helmsley Spear, Inc., 
 198.A.D.2d 131 [lst 
Dept. 19931). A challenge to "the veracity of some of the statements in the pleadings ... 
merely raises triable issues of fact" 
(LA4 Ninety CM Corp. v. 2431 
 Broaa'way Realty Co., 
170 A.D.2d 373, 374 [lst Dept. 19911). 
"A cause of action for fraud must be brought within six years from the time of the 
fraud or within two years from the time the fraud was, or with reasonable diligence could 
have been, discovered, whichever is longer'' (Yaffer v. William Morris Agency, Inc., 268 
-2- [* 3 ]
A.D.2d 335 [lst Dept. 20001; 
 NiagaraMohawk Power Corporation, 265 A.D.2d 938, 940 
[4th Dept. 19991). Plaintiff avers he did not learn of the fraud until March, 2000, despite 
having made diligent efforts for several years to find out the true circumstances of his 
investments. A fraud claim brought within six years of when "plaintiffs had sufficient facts 
to discover the alleged fraud " should not be dismissed as a matter of law based on the 
statutes of limitations 
 (Fitzgerald v. 
Zkompson, 187 A.D.2d 557 [2d Dept. 19821). "When 
a party moves to dismiss a cause of action pursuant to CPLR 321 l(a)(5) on the ground that 
it is barred by the Statute of Limitations, that party bears the initial burden of establishing 
the affirmative defense by prima facie proof that the time in which to sue has expired " 
(Assad v. City of New York, 238 A.D.2d 456,456 -457 [Zd Dept. 19971, mot for lv app dism 
91 N.Y.2d 848 [1997]). Defendants have not met this burden. 
 I'[F]actual issues as to when 
the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the alleged wrongdoing" preclude 
dismissal of a fraud claim pursuant to CPLR 321 l(a)[5] 
 (DiMaggio v. 
DiMaggzo, 278 
A.D.2d 192, 193 [Zd Dept. 20001; Gingold v. Beekman, supra). 
With respect to that branch of the motion which seeks dismissal as against the 
unspecified John Doe law partners, the court finds that "[tlhe complaint sets forth in 
sufficient detail the circumstances constituting the wrong (see CPLR 3016[b]) to survive 
defendants' motion to dismiss the fraud cause of action. It is of no consequence that the 
allegations of fraud are not directed at any one particular defendant; the complaint sets forth 
in detail the fraudulent scheme involving all defendants.. . . At this stage of the action, 
plaintiff is unable to state the circumstances of the fraudulent scheme in more detail because 
that information is exclusively in defendants' possession" (Niagara Mohawk Power 
-3 - [* 4 ]
Corporation, supra, 265 A.D.2d at 939, citations omitted). 
Accordingly, defendant's motion is denied. Defendant shall serve an answer within 
twenty (20) days from service of a copy of this order with notice of entry. 
This decision constitutes the order of the court.
