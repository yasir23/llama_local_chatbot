Joan A. Madden, J. 
The City of New York ("the City") moves to vacate the 
Inc, formerly known as Arol Development Corporation ("SDC" ) 
opposes the motion, which is granted for the reasons below. 
Backaround 
This action arises out SDC's lease of the Bronx Terminal 
Market ("Market") from the City pursuant to a sixty-nine year 
lease and development contract dated February 9, 1983, entitled 
the Second Amendment and Restatement of Lease ("Lease") Under 
'AS noted in the decision, this action is one of three 
separate, but related, actions involving the Lease. This action 
seeks damages for SDC's alleged failure to pay rent; Strateaic 
Development Concepts, Inc, f/k/a Arol Development Corp. v The 
Citv of New York, Index No. 344489/91, is for damages in 
connection with the City's failure to maintain and repair the 
viaduct on the premises; and The Citv of New York v Strateaic 
Development Concepts, Inc. f/k/a Arol Development Gorp., Index 
NO. 
repair a structure on the premises known the WH-1 Building. 
.After settlement negotiations broke down in April 2000, the City 
submitted three motions in connection with each of the three 
actions. In addition to this motion to restore, the City 45777/92 arises out of SDC's alleged failure in 1992 to [* 1 ]
the Lease, SDC is required to make certain improvements to the 
Market, which is a wholesale food market located south of Yankee 
Stadium. The Market contains several buildings, including a six- 
story structure built originally as a refrigerated warehouse, 
known as the WH-1 Building. The WH-1 Building was originally 
surrounded by a viaduct structure which provided access to the 
market. The second floor of the WH-1 Building was used as a 
loading dock for trucks making deliveries to the Market via the 
viaduct. By 1991, the viaduct had fallen into disrepair and in 
or about April 1995, the City demolished it based on asserted 
concerns for the public safety. 
In this action, which was commenced in 1991, the City 
alleges that SDC owes millions of dollars in back rent from the 
beginning of the lease term in 1983. In its answer, SDC denies 
that it owes back rent, asserting, inter alia, that it has taken 
credits against rent due to the City in accordance with various 
provisions of the Lease. 
Two other actions were commenced in the early 1990's 
regarding the Lease. Prior to the commencement of this action, 
SDC filed Strateaic DeveloDment Concepts, Inc, f/k/a Ar,ol 
Development Corp. v The City of New York, Index No. 344489/91, in 
submitted a motion to restore Index No. 45777/92 to the court's 
calendar (motion seq. no. 002). The City has also moved to amend 
its answer to assert additional counterclaims in Index NO. 
.34489/91 (motion seq. no. 006). 
2 [* 2 ]
which it alleged that the City breached the Lease by failing to 
maintain the viaduct ("the Viaduct Case"). By decision and order 
dated January 28, 1994, SDC was granted partial summary judgment 
in the Viaduct Case. The Court found that the City, as opposed 
to SDC, was obligated under the Lease to maintain, repair or 
replace the viaduct, and that City was in default of its 
obligations under the Lease. This decision and order was 
affirmed on appeal. The City demolished the viaduct in 1995 
after SDC's request for injunctive relief was denied. 
In addition, in 1992, the City brought an action against 
SDC based on an October 13, 1992 notice of default alleging SDC's 
failure to maintain and repair the WH-1 Building (The City of New 
York v Strateaic Development Concepts, Inc. f/k/a Arol 
Development Corp., Index. No. 45777/92) ("the WH-1 Case") .2 
On October 12, 1993, the parties to this action entered into 
a preliminary conference order requiring that a note of issue be 
filed by June 13, 1994. In 1993, the City served, and SDC 
responded to, the City's First Set of Interrogatories and 
Document Requests. The City also took the deposition of 
Christian Olsen, the property manager for SDC, on four separate 
days between 1994 and 1996. Moreover, according to the City's 
2The WH-1 Case was marked off the calendar in July 1994 and 
dismissed one year later pursuant to CPLR 3404, and this Court 
has denied the City's recent motion to vacate the dismissal and 
restore it to the court's calendar.

attorney, Majorie Landa "Landa") , some of the extensive 
discovery conducted in the Viaduct Case in 1997 and 1998 related 
to this action. 
On March 18, 1997, this action was marked off the calendar, 
after the City failed to answer a clerk's calendar call. A year 
later, this action was automatically dismissed pursuant to CPLR 
3404. In August 1997, after this action was marked off, and with 
the consent of SDC, the City amended its complaint to include a 
caption reflecting the new name of SDC and to update the period 
during which the City sought rent arrears. In September 1997, SDC 
served and filed an answer. In December 1998, the parties began 
settlement discussions aimed at resolving all disputes, including 
those in this action. These discussions broke down in April 
2000. Shortly thereafter, the City alleges it firt became aware 
that this case had been marked off and dismissed, and by notice 
of motion dated June 16, 2000, it made this motion to restore 
this action. 
The City argues that restoration is proper here as it has a 
meritorious cause of action for rent arrears, it did not intend 
to abandon the action, it did not learn that the action was 
marked off until settlement negotiations ended, and that as there 
., has been discovery in this action and the note of issue has not 
been filed, SDC will not be prejudiced by the delay. 
SDC counters that the City abandoned this action after 
4 [* 4 ]
summary judgment was granted in SDC's favor in the Viaduct Case 
and the decision affirmed on appeal, and that the City's failure 
to file a note of issue in accordance with the preliminary 
conference order establishes that it did not intend to pursue 
this action. SDC also asserts that City has provided 
insufficient proof as to the merits of this action, and that this 
action is time-barred, as it was dismissed in March 1998. SDC 
further argues that SDC has been prejudiced by the three-year 
delay in restoring this action as one of the individuals who 
drafted and negotiated the 1983 Lease has died and the other, 
David Buntzman, the President and Chief Executive Officer of SDC, 
is 92 years-old. 
Discussion 
A case pending in this court which is marked "off" on a 
clerk's call and not restored within one year thereafter, "'shall 
be deemed abandoned and shall be dismissed without costs for 
neglect to prosecute.'" Ronsco Constr. Co. v 30 East 8Sth Street 
.I Co 219 A.D.2d 281 (lst Dept 1996) auotinq CPLR 3404. Here, the 
court's records indicate that the case was marked off on March 
18, 1997. Thus, pursuant to CPLR 3404, this action was deemed 
abandoned and dismissed on March 18, 1998. 
However, the statute only creates a presumption of 
abandonment which may be rebutted by proof that the litigation is 
in progress. See, e.u., RamDuti v Timko Contractinu Corp., 262 
5 [* 5 ]
A.D.2d 26, 27 (lst Dept 1999) (presumption of abandonment rebutted 
where plaintiff provided evidence that it participated in 
discovery during the period that the action was marked off). To 
succeed on a motion to restore, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) 
the existence of a meritorious case of action, (2) a reasonable 
excuse for the delay, (3) lack of an intent to abandon, and(4) an 
absence of prejudice to the nonmoving party in the event the 
action is restored. Zabari v Citv of New York, 242 A.D.2d 15 (Ist 
Dept 1998). Here, the City has established its entitlement to 
restore this action to the active calendar. 
As to the merits of the action, the City has submitted 
sufficient proof to warrant restoration. Although various 
provisions of the Lease may entitle SDC to substantial credits 
against rent, particularly based on the demolition of the 
viaduct,3 the City submits excerpts of Mr. Olsen's deposition 
testimony which suggests that the amount of these credits has not 
been established. a, Zabari v Citv of New York, 242 A.D.2d, at 
17 ("a deposition transcript is an adequate substitution for an 
affidavit of merits"). In addition, SDC is wrong when it argues 
For instance, SDC relies on Article 14 of the Lease 
relating to condemnation of the premises. 
provides that 'if there shall be a partial taking of the 
taking as to the part so taken and shall continue in full force 
and effect as to the remainder of the premises under the lease, 
except that Lessee shall be entitled to a reduction of in the 
Basic rent, additional rent, and other charges payable under the 
,Lease.. . . Paragraph 14.3.1 
' Premises, then this lease shall terminate as of the date of such 
N

the City‘s claims are time-barred based on a dismissal under CPLR 
3404. See, e.a., Fiumefreddo v Champion Trucks Rental, Inc., 194 
A.D.2d 346 (lst Dept 1993)(action restored fourteen years after 
plaintiff sustained injuries that provided the basis for his 
claim). 
Next, the City has established a lack of an intent to 
abandon this action through its attention to this action during 
the period after it was marked off the calendar. See, Weiss v 
City of New York, 247 A.D.2d 239, 241 (lst Dept 1998) (a 
“plaintifffs attention to outstanding matters during the interim 
sufficiently evinced his continued interest in the litigation”). 
Specifically, the City filed an amended complaint after this 
action was marked off and engaged in settlement discussions. 
Moreover, in 1997 and 1998, the City pursued discovery in the 
Viaduct Case related to this action. 
Furthermore, no real prejudice has been showed resulting 
from the three-year delay in restoring this action. Notably, 
there has already been discovery in this case, the note of issue 
has not yet been filed, and further discovery may be ordered. 
Moreover, although he is 92 years-old, SDC does not claim that 
Mr. Buntzman would be unable to testify, and in fact, the City 
, notes that he recently testified for two days in the Viaduct 
Case. And, significantly, SDC does not claim that there are no 
other witnesses available with knowledge regarding the relevant 
7 [* 7 ]
the Lease provisions. 
Under these circumstances, the City's inadvertence in 
realizing this action had been marked off should be excused, and 
the motion to restore the case to the active calendar should be 
granted.4 "[A] client should not be deprived of [its] day in 
court by his attorney's neglect or inadvertent error, especially 
where the other party cannot show prejudice ...[ and] the complaint 
has merit." Paoli v Sullcraft Manufacturina Co., 104 A.D.2d 333, 
334 (1" Dept 1984). 
Conclusion 
In view of the above, it is 
ORDERED that the motion is granted and this action is 
restored to the active calendar in Part 11, and the parties are 
directed to appear for a conference in Part 11 on May 3, 2001. 
DATED: April /k, 2001 
The City argues in reply that CPLR 3404 does not apply to 
this action because it was not on the trial calendar at the time 
it was marked off. While the majority of cases discussing CPLR 
3404 involve actions marked off the trial calendar, the City is 
incorrect that this action cannot be dismissed under the statute 
because it was marked off before the note of issue was filed.
