Plaintiffs move (009) to reject in part and confirm in part the 
report dated May 24, 2000, (the "Report") of Judicial Hearing 
Officer ("JHO"), Hon. Martin Evans, so as to increase the amount for 
their attorneys' fees to $3.5 million and to recover their entire 
expenses of $227,607.73 to the date of the settlement hearing and an 
additional $87,003.50 since then. 
William C. Rand ("Rand"), the objecting stockholder, moves 
(008) likewise, to confirm in part and reject in part the Report to 
reduce the fees recommended to $184,375 and the expenses to 
$40,107.84. 
I. Background 
The facts have been detailed in Seinfeld v Robinson (172 Misc 
2d 159 [Sup Ct, NY County 19971, revd, 246 AD2d 291 [lst Dept 19981 1, 
and in the JHO's Report. 
On February 3, 1999, this court directed a reference to hear 
and report on: (1) the value of the benefit to Amex of plaintiffs' 
recovery on its behalf, and (2) the amount of attorneys' fees and 
disbursements to be paid to plaintiffs' counsel. This order was 
affirmed in a memorandum decision stating in part: "While we clearly 
found [on the prior appeal, 246 AD2d 2911 that a substantial benefit 
was conferred on the subject corporation, the referral was not 
improper since, if nothing else, the referral serves as a reminder 
that a factor in assessing the amount of the fee to be awarded is 
the degree to which plaintiffs' attorneys' services benefitted the 
22304/90 ...p age 2 of 18 [* 4 ]
corporation, and that such benefit must therefore be weighed and 
evaluated, even if unquantifiable (see, United Operatinu Co. v. 
Karnes, 482 F Supp 1029, 1031, 1032)." -AD2D-, 715 NYS2d 404, 405 
(lst Dept 2000). 
JHO Evans held hearings on January 14 and 27, 2000, February 9, 
2000, and May 22, 2000. Three firms testified at the hearing: lead 
counsel for plaintiffs, Abbey, Gardy & Squitieri ("Abbey"), Wechsler 
Harwood Halebian & Feffer ("Wechsler"), and Milberg Weiss Bershad 
Hynes Lerach ("Milberg"). The other firms submitted affidavits 
received in evidence. An expert for the plaintiffs also testified.' 
After the hearing, JHO Evans issued the Report and filed it 
without the transcripts of testimony. The Report recommended 
applying a blended compensation rate averaging $353 per hour 
embracing the rates in effect from 1990 through 1996. JHO Evans 
recommended that the court apply this rate to 2,500 hours, the time 
he found the matter should reasonably have required. He calculated 
total fees of $881,110' to be reduced by time spent on unnecessary 
duplication of effort (the amount of which he did not specify). He 
then increased the rate to $400 per hour "for the fact that the case 
was taken on a contingency basis" and derived a recommended fee of 
$1,000,000, with interest from February 1, 1997. He recommended 
' Plaintiffs sought $3,185,388.77 in fees incurred since the 
inception of this case through February 8, 2000. This represents 
a lodestar amount of $2,659,293.75 for 7,524.45 hours of work, 
multiplied by 1.19. 
Arithmetically, the figure should have been $882,500. 
22304/90 ...p age 3 of 18 [* 5 ]
reimbursement of expenses without those incurred in the fee-seeking 
phase and those incurred by one firm for the unsuccessful Federal 
prosecution. The net of these was $203,681.32. 
11. Timeliness of Rand's motion 
Plaintiffs' attorneys aver that the first they learned that the 
JHO had filed his Report was on July 11, 2000 when they received a 
copy of Rand's motion. Plaintiffs contend that Rand's motion is 
untimely because he implicitly waived the requirement that the 
transcript be filed with the Report. Therefore, they imply that the 
time for Rand's motion ran from May 24 when the Report was filed 
without exhibits and transcripts. Plaintiffs overlook the danger to 
their own motion in making their untimeliness argument. 
Uniform Rules--Trial Courts § 202.44 (a) prescribes that the JHO 
or referee appointed to hear and report give notice to each party 
that his report has been filed together with the transcript and 
exhibits. 'This could not have occurred at bar because JHO Evans did 
not file the transcript and exhibits. Plaintiffs are given 15 days 
after such notice to make a motion to confirm or reject failing 
which the "defendant" has 30 days after notice of such filing to so 
move. CPLR 4320 (b) provides that, unless otherwise stipulated, a 
transcript of the testimony, together with the exhibits or copies 
thereof, shall be filed with the report. The Report, without the 
transcript or exhibits, was filed on May 24, 2000. Rand's motion is 
dated July 10, 2000. There is no indication that the parties 
stipulated to excuse filing the transcript and the exhibits with the 
22304/90 ...p age 4 of 18 [* 6 ]
Report. Rand did not order the transcript. Plaintiffs' attorneys 
provided the court with the transcript and exhibits. 
Since no transcript or exhibits were filed with the Report, the 
deadline to file a motion did not begin to run and Rand's motion was 
timely filed. The same reasoning applies to plaintiffs' motion 
dated July 24, 2000. 
111. The Settlement's Benefits To Amex 
Both sides disagree with the JHO's finding of the extent to 
which the settlement of the derivative suit benefitted Amex. 
Plaintiffs argue that they should receive all of the attorneys' fees 
they seek because the harm to Amex from the Safra affair was great, 
and was greatly remedied by Amex's adoption of the Resolutions. 
Rand argues that the Resolutions conferred minimal benefits on Amex, 
and that the attorneys' fees should be commensurately reduced. 
At the hearing, plaintiffs' expert on corporate governance, 
Professor Ted J. Fiflis, testified about the negative effect that 
the Safra affair had on Amex's reputation, and the subsequent 
positive effect of the Resolutions. In Professor Fiflis' opinion, 
the publicity about the Safra affair was responsible for a drop in 
the market value of Amex shares of between $150 million and $650 
million. Yet, Professor Fiflis admitted that he was not a 
securities fraud damages expert. JHO Evans commented that the 
negative publicity might have caused some loss to Amex shares but 
that too many other factors might have accounted for this. JHO 
Evans observed that plaintiffs had not adduced any evidence of 
22304/90 ...p age 5 of 18 - [* 7 ]
increases in share value at or near the time of the settlement to 
support this market theory of benefit. 
Instead, JHO Evans valued the benefit of these short term 
resolutions on the costs to Amex of the Safra affair because they 
would prevent future damages of a similar nature.3 These consisted 
of $1 million paid to Greco, $8 million donated to chari-ty and other 
related costs. The total approximates $15 million. The JHO then 
derived a net benefit4 from the Resolutions measured as one third of 
the total monetary cost to Amex of the Safra affair. This one-third 
amounted to $5 million. The difficulty with this determination is 
that it is based entirely on speculation. There is nothing in the 
report or in the evidence to explain how the one-third discount was 
derived. 
Fundamentally, JHO Evans piled one speculation atop another to 
reach his result based on value of the benefit of these Resolutions. 
There is no logic or evidence that would measure the benefit of a 
Resolution with a four year life designed to prevent a recurrence of 
Judge Evans rejected Rand‘s argument that the Resolutions 
mirrored earlier proposals of the Audit Committee on the ground 
that the Appellate Division had already diminished the 
significance of the proposals in contrast to the Resolutions. 
Seinfeld v. Robinson, 246 AD2d at 299. 
4Part of his consideration of this net benefit stemmed from 
certain palliative measures recommended by the Audit committee 
that Judge Evans asserted “would most likely have been adopted.” 
These he found in Exhibit 13, not received in evidence, and 
Exhibits 18 and 19 dated July 1990 and February 4, 1992. It is 
unknown whether these references are to the same earlier proposals 
of the Audit committee that the Appellate Division found 
insignificant. See fn 3, supra. - 
22304/90 ...p age 6 of 18 [* 8 ]
the wrongdoing that characterizes the Safra affair based on the cost 
to Amex of rectifying the wrong done to Safra. Moreover, there is 
a public policy concern militating against such a valuation: The 
corporation for whose benefit the derivative action is brought will 
be forced to pay double for settling the initial impropriety. This 
might very well discourage settlement of the original claim in 
preference to full scale litigation. Beyond this concern, there is 
no logic in valuing these resolutions on the basis of the cost of 
settling the Safra affair any more than on the loss on the Shearson 
investment. Finally, Judge Evans included in his basic $15 million 
cost of the Safra affair the donation of $8 million that, as the 
Appellate Division observed, was "already earmarked for charitable 
contributions by Amex." 246 AD2d at 293. Eliminating this sum 
yields a net cost of the Safra affair of only $7 million one third 
of which would amount to $2.33 million-less than half the figure 
that the JHO's speculation yielded. 
A. Burden of Proof 
While the JHO did not discuss the burden of proving plaintiffs' 
entitlement to a fee including the value of the "substantial 
benefit" their settlement bestowed on Amex, it is appropriate to 
observe that the burden does rest on plaintiffs. Henslev v. 
Eckerhart, 461 US 424, 437 (1983); Raqin v. Harrv Macklowe Real 
Estate Co., 870 F.Supp. 510, 515 (SDNY 1994); but see, Matter of 
Cohen (Four Wav Features), 168 Misc 2d 91, 93-94 (Sup. Ct. NY Cty, 
1995) [Crane, J.], aff'd, 240 AD2d 225 (lst Dept 1997) [ascribing to 
22304/90 ...p age 7 of 18 
:.- [* 9 ]
the court rather than either party the burden of establishing the 
fair value of shares pursuant to BCL §1118 in a corporate 
dissolution proceeding]. 
B. Resolution I 
Resolution I applied to outside consultants/investigators hired 
at a cost of $150,000 or more per engagement. Resolution I did not 
apply to investigative services relating to fraud in connection with 
credit cards, traveler's checks, lending or other businesses, 
background checks for employment or promotion decisions, and 
investigative services rendered under the direction of outside legal 
counsel. 
The record reveals that, beginning in 1989, Amex adopted a 
policy regarding outside services and consultants which was modified 
several times. The latest version of the policy in the records 
(Exhibit 41) is dated July 1995. It required that a particular 
request foim be completed whenever outside services or consultants 
were retained at a cost exceeding $25,000, whether per consultant or 
per project. 
The difference between Resolution I and the policy that the 
company already had in place at the time of the settlement was that 
the Resolution applied to consultants costing $150,000 and more, and 
included provisions regarding the general counsel, the internal 
audit department, and compliance with the Code of Conduct. 
Plaintiffs argue that the Resolution would have prevented Greco' s 
actions that led to the Safra scandal. Rand has pointed out that 
22304/90 ...p age 8 of 18 - [* 10 ]
Resolution I could easily be circumvented because it does not apply 
to investigative services hired by outside legal counsel or in 
regard to “other businesses .I’ The latter phrase could be 
interpreted to take in any kind of outside consulting at any cost. 
Rand argues that the Resolution, which applies to payments of 
$150,000 and up, would not have been applied to Grecb, as he was 
paid in installments of $30,000 or less. Professor Fiflis argues 
that the Resolution would have alerted the company to Greco because 
an auditor would have noticed the multiple payments to a single 
investigator (Exhibit U, affidavit of Professor Ted J. Fiflis, p. 
7).’ But, under the Amex policy, all single payments of more than 
$25,000 would be examined. The Amex policy obviates the need to 
speculate on whether an auditor would notice multiple payments to 
the same person. 
C. Resolution I1 
Resol’ution I1 provided that the company would not acquire more 
than 50% of the voting power of any outstanding voting stock of an 
investment banking business unless such acquisition was approved by 
a majority of the outside directors. Rand points out that the votes 
of the outside directors guarantee nothing, as they can easily 
authorize wrongdoing. Plaintiffs argue that Resolution I1 would 
prevent future improvident acquisitions. The testimony at the 
This expert speculation fails to account for the 
circumstance in the Safra affair itself: There was no alarm 
sounded back in the 1980’s by the auditor who “would have noticed 
the multiple payments to a single investigator,” Greco. - 
22304/90 ...p age 9 of 18 
:c [* 11 ]
hearing with respect to Resolution 11, and there is little of it, is 
even more speculative than that with respect to Resolution I. There 
is no evidence to show that the adoption of Resolution I1 was 
instrumental in restoring Amex‘s reputation or its stock prices. 
D. Summary 
Nothing in the record supports JHO Evans‘ finding that the 
value of the Resolutions would extend beyond their four-year 
expiration date.6 Rather, the evidence indicates that the 
Resolutions conferred minimal benefits on Amex. 
This leaves the court with a void in valuing the “substantial 
benefit” that is an important element in quantifying plaintiffs‘ 
claim for attorneys fees. The Appellate Division seems to indicate 
the path this court is asked to follow in fixing these fees. It has 
twice referred to United Operatinu Co. v. Karnes, 482 F. Supp. 1029 
at 246 AD2d at 300 and in affirming the order directing the 
reference to hear and report. Indeed, the opinion at 246 AD2d 291, 
300 stated “The Karnes court, presented with a fee request for 
$125,000, awarded counsel $40,503.18. The benefit conferred in 
He said: “While the resolutions are only in effect for 4 
years, they will have an impact on the governance of this 
Corporation for many years into the future, even if they were not 
to be extended. Corporate culture and tradition has a way of 
continuing itself, and a failure to follow the traditions 
expressed by these Resolutions would not be considered proudly by 
the many distinguished and responsible directors of the 
corporation.“ Not only is this sentiment undermined by the 
Appellate Division‘s opinion at 246 AD2d 291, 298 [“The motion 
court viewed this benefit as of little value since a ‘reoccurrence . . . is unlikely’. . . .We disagree.”], but JHO Evans’ optimistic 
observation finds no support in the record. 
22304/90 ...p age 10 of 18 [* 12 ]
Karnes is analoaous to the resolutions adopted in this case." 
[Emphasis added.] The Karnes court awarded 32.4% of the fee 
requested. 
IV. Hearsay Objections 
At an early stage of the proceeding, the JHO ruled that it was 
not necessary for all of the attorneys to testify at 'the hearing. 
This was done in order to reduce the expenses and inconvenience of 
the attorneys and the parties, and because some of the attorneys 
were in other states. Rand was given the option of deposing a 
certain number of the attorneys and having the others appear at the 
hearing. Rand deposed only one attorney, who also testified at the 
hearing. Over Rand's hearsay objections, the affidavits and time 
records of the attorneys who did not testify at the hearing were 
received into evidence. 
Rand has raised several factual issues with regard to the 
attorneys'' time records, which, if he had raised them in an 
affidavit opposing the attorneys' affidavits on a motion, would have 
entitled him to a hearing with live testimony (see, Bankers Federal 
Savinas Bank FSB v. Off West Broadwav Developers, 224 AD2d 376, 378 
[lst Dept 19961 ) . A hearing was ordered in this case. This required 
that testimony be taken. 
A deposition is a disclosure device and with respect to 
disclosure, the role of the court is merely supervisory; it does not 
include ordering a party to take a deposition (Carol1 v. Gammerman, 
193 AD2d 202, 205 [lst Dept 19931). A deposition is not a substitute 
22304/90 ...p age 11 of 18 [* 13 ]
for testimony in open court, except under certain limited conditions 
(see, CPLR 3117, governing the use of depositions at trial). 
This is not a case where a party chose to take a deposition and 
later discovered that the deponent was unavailable for trial. The 
JHO determined beforehand that some of the attorneys need not appear 
at the hearing, even though seven of the attorneys' firms are 
situated in New York, and the eighth, headquartered in Pennsylvania, 
has been performing work in New York. There are no exceptional 
circumstances to warrant the absence of the attorneys from a hearing 
designed to determine their fees. 
Where affidavits have been allowed in lieu of live testimony 
on direct examination, the adversary's right to cross examination 
was preserved in Campaim for Fiscal Equitv v State of New York, 182 
Misc 2d 676 [Sup Ct, NY County 19991; Siegel, NY Prac §396 (3d ed. 
August 2000 Pocket Part, p. 25). There, my brother, Justice 
DeGrasse, provided that the affiant would swear in open court to the 
truth of his/her affidavit before undergoing cross-examination. 
Despite, the large number of witnesses, the court emphasized the 
importance of each one appearing at trial (id. at 677-678). This 
principle was overlooked in the reference under scrutiny at bar. 
The use of depositions at trial must be carefully restricted 
because the right to cross-examine is fundamental. It ensures the 
opposing party a chance to present its side and the fact-finder an 
opportunity to discover the truth (State of New York v. Metz, 241 
AD2d 192, 199 [lst Dept 19981). 
- 
22304/90 ...p age 12 of 18 
:c [* 14 ]
Therefore, the time records of the attorneys who did not 
testify should not have been admitted in evidence and should be 
disregarded. 
V. Fees For Time Spent Seeking Fees 
In deciding whether to award fees for time spent by counsel in 
the fee application process, courts draw a distinction between two 
kinds of cases (Savoie v. Merchants Bank, 166 F3d 456, 461 [Znd Cir 
19991). In one class of cases, counsel is not entitled to fees for 
seeking fees where they will be drawn from a common fund. This is 
based on the theory that the fund was created for the benefit of a 
group or class, has already been diminished by an award of fees, and 
should not be diminished by an additional award (id.). In the other 
category, an award of fees for seeking fees has been allowed under 
statutes where the wrongdoer, and not the plaintiffs, are paying the 
fees (id.). 
In th’is case, the settlement did not create a common fund or 
obtain a recovery of any kind for the plaintiffs, and conferred very 
slender benefits on Amex. Therefore, the attorneys here will not be 
allowed to recover fees seeking fees. In that respect, the Report 
will be confirmed.‘ 
Judge Evans reported: “The general rule is that hours spent 
in requesting fees, or in establishing the amount thereof, is not 
compensable, and I see no reason in this case to recommend the 
adoption of any different rule.” Report, p. 5. Thus, he 
disqualified 3,622.05 hours of the grand total of 6,744.3 hours 
for all law firms. 1 
22304/90 ...p age 13 of 18 [* 15 ]
VI. Hours Billed And Hourly Rates 
The Report stated that the total number of hours reasonably 
necessary to bring about the result in this action was 2,500 hours. 
(Report, p. 5). JHO Evans did not supply his calculations in this 
respect. He did observe generally that there had been unreasonable 
duplication among firms. (a, p. 9). The Report also recommended 
a blended hourly rate of $353 based on time charges in effect at the 
times the services were actually rendered.* He elevated this rate 
to an arbitrary and unexplained $400 per hour due to the contingent 
risk in the representation. He believed that an award of interest 
at the agreed rate of 5.118 would compensate for the use of historic 
rates rather than those in effect today. 
The party seeking fees has the burden of establishing their 
reasonableness (Gutierrez v. Direct Marketina Credit Services, 267 
AD2d 427, 427-428 [2nd Dept 19991). The attorneys here have failed 
to address' the JHO's and Rand's numerous objections to their hourly 
rates, time spent on legal work, duplication of effort, etc. They 
have not met their burden. The burden is on the fee applicant to 
produce satisfactory evidence that the requested rates are in line 
with those prevailing in the community for similar services by 
lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation 
(Savoie v. Merchants Bank, supra, 166 F3d, at 463). In addition to 
* Based on 2,500 hours Judge Evans derived a grand total of 
$881,110. See, fn. 2, supra. - 
22304/90 ...p age 14 of 18 [* 16 ]
looking at prevailing market rates, the Court may rely on its own 
knowledge of comparable rates charged by other lawyers in the 
jurisdiction when setting rates (Williams v. New York Citv Housinq 
Authoritv, 975 F Supp 317, 322 [SDNY 19971). 
In recognition of the excessive fees, the JHO reduced the post- 
settlement hours by 4,244.3 to 2,500. This figure cannot be used 
because it applies to all of the law firms, not just the ones that 
testified at the hearing. Therefore, the plaintiffs would suffer a 
double reduction if the fees of non-testifying firms are eliminated 
in addition to capping the remainder at 2,500 hours. Besides, this 
court has no way of discerning how the JHO derived this limitation. 
The lodestar figure is calculated by multiplying the number of 
hours reasonably expended by the prevailing rates for the services 
provided (In Re Metropolitan Life Derivative Litiqation, 935 F Supp 
286, 294-295 [SDNY 19961). Current rates may be used to compensate 
the plaintiff for inflation and loss of interest that had taken 
place between the time when the legal services were rendered and 
when the fees were awarded (New York State Association for Retarded 
Children v. Carey, 711 F2d 1136, 1152 [2nd Cir 19831). However, the 
current rates need not be used in cases involving protracted 
litigation where the current inflated rates do not reflect 
accurately the loss attributable to delay (d.), and the JHO 
declined to use them. 
Because he used past rates elevated for contingency, rather 
than current rates, the JHO allowed the attorneys 5.11% interest. 
22304/90 ...p age 15 of 18 [* 17 ]
Generally, when current rates are used, interest is not allowed 
(Savoie v Merchants Bank, suDra, 166 F3d at 464). "An award of 
interest on a lodestar fee calculated on the basis of current hourly 
rates would have resulted in overcompensation" (d., and see, 
Huntinaton Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntinaton, 961 F2d 1048, 1049 
(2nd Cir 1992). The attorneys here will be granted 32.4% of their 
pre-settlement fees, as shown by the chart in the footnote. ' The 
total fees for the three firms amounts to $453,902.44. As 
recommended by Judge Evans, interest will be added to this figure at 
the rate of 5.11% from February 1, 1997. 
VII. Adjustments To The Lodestar Figure 
Once the "straight" lodestar is calculated, the court must 
consider whether an enhancement or decrease is warranted. The JHO 
adjusted the lodestar upwards to $1 million by recognizing the 
contingent nature of the representation and selecting a $400 per 
hour blended rate, but without explaining the reason for the amount 
of the increase. A multiplier may be applied to the lodestar based 
on certain less objective factors such as contingent risk, superior

60 [2d Cir. 19991). The use of multipliers should be subjected to 
a stringent determination where no common fund has been-created and 
the non-monetary relief is not readily capable of valuation (id.). 
The court does not find that the case was complex enough or the 
results outstanding enough to warrant the application of any 
multiplier. 
VIII. Expenses 
With respect to pre-settlement expenses, Abbey seeks 
$29,910.99, Wechsler, $7,203.80; and Milberg, $137,592.77. Out of 
Milberg's expenses, $93,858.21 was paid to an investigative firm 
retained to investigate Greco's activities abroad that eventually 
found him in Europe and procured his release from prison. Milberg's 
hotel accommodations are billed at $8,196.79, meals at $1,026.57, 
and travel at $13,487.86. 
Abbey and Wechsler will be reimbursed all of their expenses. 
Milberg's expenses will be reduced to $21,023.34, to reflect the 
failure to justify the trips and investigator. The total expenses 
amount to $58,138.13. 
Accordingly, it is 
ORDERED that the motions are granted in part and otherwise 
denied; and it is further
