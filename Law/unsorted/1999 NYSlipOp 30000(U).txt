JUSTICE BRUCE ALLEN: 
Respondent Hoag is an attorney. In June 1996, petitioner 
retained respondent to represent petitioner in a matrimonial 
. I 
action which had been filed in New York County. By--November 1996; 
I 
the relationship between petitioner and respondertt had become 
, ! 
strained and petiticiner eventually ~etained new coun~el. I 1 i .

j client who has filed a request for such arbitra .tion has thirty 
days to withdraw the request. See, 22 NYCRR §136. Petitioner '_did 
eventually file a request for such arbitration in the First

Judicial District. 
I Petitioner also filed grievances against r;e?p9ndept with the · I ' I 
New York State Bar Association and yhe Departme,ntal Discip

Committee. In addition to complaints of overbilling and 
incompetent represenfation, the grievances con~ended that·; 
resppndent did not mkintain an off i¢e in the State of New ~ork 
and was not ~uly licensed in 
petitioner. (While the issue ' ' i New York at the time she represented 
I 
' is n6tldirectly before this court, I:·! 
it. should be noted that respondent ·• s position throughout has been· . , I

that' she has been in full compliance with the off ice requirement.

parties appeared and 1submitted . ' 
I : I I 
on September 24, 1998. Both i , I ; , .. 
evidence. Oh October 1, 1998, the I ,· 
panel issued.its determination that:respondent was entitled to 
I ' 
: I 
$20,000 (out of the $30;000 she had:claimed). The "STATEMENT OF 
I I :' : \ 
REASONS" simply stated that the preponderance of evidence 
indicated that the above.amount is reasonable. Petitioner now . I . 
seeks to ~av4 t~e arbitration awar~ vacated. Respondent seeks an 
order confirming the award. 
I I 
The grounds on which an arbitration award can be vacated; 
2 [* 2]
I 
I which are set out in CPLR §7511, are narrow. An award will not 
normally be set ,aside because of errors of law or· fact by the 
arbitrators unless they render the award irrational. Sprinzen v. 
--N omberg, · 46 N .. Y. 2d 623; Carty v. Nationwide Insurance Company, . I 
212 A.D.2d~ 462 (l.!'t Dept. 1995). The standard of review is less , I 
exacting in cases where the arbitration was voluntary rather than 
I 
compulsory. Matter of Furstenberg, 49 N.Y.2d-.757. 
Petitioner attacks the actions of the arbitrators on a 
variety of specific grounds. The main gist of her complaint, 
however, is that the arbitrators refused to consider certain 
issues raised by petitioner -including the question of 
res~ondent's registration status and maintenance-of .an office in 
New York -which petiti.oner maintains go to respondent's right to 
' I collect any fee at all. Pet'.itionel'.1
1:•.s position appears to be that 
I I 
the arbitrat6rs sho~ld eitd~r havJ ·addressed these issue~ or 
should ha~e declin~d t~ ·h~~~ th~· Jase. 'Petitioner contends that 
the failure of· th0
e arbitra~ors to/ do either one or the oth~r .has 
resulted in an award so imperfectly executed that it leaves the 
: I ,/ 
parties unable to· clea.rly ~etermLn~ their rights. The award 
specifies t~at fhe respondent is e~titled to $20,000 as the 
reasonable value of her legal serv.ices. However, petition~r 
' . ' ' contends that the continuing inves'tigation of respondent by the 
! Third Department Committee on Proflessional Standards could result . . I 
in a finding that respondent was not entitled to collect any fees I . 
for legal work in the State of New York; however, that while that· 
ruling would preclude respondent collecting fees, it would not 
3 [* 3]
,. :··-·-I 
\ 1: require her to refund to petitioner fees which petitioner has 
already paid her.· 
The problem with the petitioner's position is that it 
I : 
overlooks the fact that it was petitioner, and petitioner alone, 
who chose the forum. Respondent's claims against petitioner would . I . ~ 
presumably have been resolved in cJurt except that petitioner Ji 
I ' I . . . 
exercised her exclusive rigpt to ·r~quire that the matter be ! 
! 
sub~itted to arbitration. i 
At the outset of the arbitration proceedings, there:was some 
discussion as to whether : t·he First /Judicial District was the 
proper geographical district for a .fee arbitration. The 
arbitrators eventually decided th~t it was, because the· 
underlying divorce proceedi'ng was' filed .in the district. This 
I I clearly appears to be a proper ruring under 22 NYCRR §136. 
I . j 
There was also :discus~ii :on of iv/hat.: issues w~uld and .would not 
be covered by the arbitrat1"j°:n. The 'a.rbitrators informed the 
petitioner that they would determJne only ~he reasonable value of 
I ; I . . . , . I .. , .. . . the services pe.rformed by r:espondent ,and. would not make any . . : I . 
ruling on' issues such.as whether ' re~pondent was duly registered , I , ·1 I · 
• I or maintained an office in New York'. As one arbitrator stated to 
petitioner: 
I ' 
.. ; . we' re only authorized1 to determine as 
best we can based on th~ evidence and 
testimony whether the f e1es that were 
charged were reasonable :and the servi·ces 
that were done and shoul~ have been billed 
.for. accordingly. It's ~e1ally . all we have 
the authority to determihe. This is not a 
griev~nce committee. Thiis is not an ethics 
panel.: This is not a ma!lpractice panel ... 
We are only empowered tC?: determine whether

the fee is reasonable for the services 
rendered and whether or not one person, the 
client has been overcharged or has oyerpaid 
or whether the attorney has not been paid 
the full amount they're ~ntitled to· 
rec._ei ve. It's really all we' re empowered to 
determine. So, I'm asking you now, are you. 
asking us to hear our case? 
It was not error for the arbitrators to limit the issues in 
this manner. The subject matter of fee arbitration under 22 NYCRR 
§136 is generally limited to the reasonableness of the fee in 
light of the amount of work performed and the rates set out in 
the: retainer agreement. McNamee. Lochner, Titus & Williams, P.C. 
v. Killeen, 235 A.D.2d 17 ~3rd Dept. 1997). 
As petitioner notes, in McMahon v. Evans, 169 Misc~2d 509 
{Sup. Ct., Broome C~unty 19,96), th~ court found -that whether a 
fee could be charge~ and collected without a violation of the 
I , , ! , C,ode of Professional Responsibility was a . : i " 
. arbitrato :rs could c~nsider I ln determining 
the fee. 1he alleged viola~ibn:in McMahon factor which th~ 
the.reasonableness of 
was the f ajlure to 
provide a wr·itten retainer . agreement .. The court stated: "The Code 
I I . I. effectively precludes a.n attorney from collecting any fee where 
there is no written retainer in any case where one is required 
under the ma.trim6nial rules, and certainly, such a. fee could not 
be reasonabl .e if it were expressly precluded by court rule,, 11 
' The sit.uation here differs from that in McMahon. The alleged 
violation alleged in McMahon involved the specific work and 
retainer: agreement with the indivi~ual client. Here, petitioner 
I 
wished to raise issues pertaining .to respondent's general fitness 
5 \ 
L.- . !J 2:u m-=-::::zi:::i [* 5]
( to charge for legal services in New York. More~ver, as petitioner 
informed the arbitrators, the allegations were the subject of an. 
ongoing invest_igation by the Third Department Corrunittee on 
Professional s·tandards, conunenced at petitioner• s behest. Given 
those circumstances, it clearly was-hot irrational for the 
arbitrators to decline to consider those issues. 
Under 22 NYCRR §136.4, the administrative judge may decline 
to accept or continue to arbitrate ·a dispute in which· substantial 
legal questions are raised in addition to the basic fee dispute. 
Petitioner contends that if the arbitrators were not going to 
consider the issues she raised, they should have sought a ruling 
from the administrative judge on whether to decline to hear the 
cas~. Petitioner also clai~s that she objected :t0 going forward 
with the arbitratio* going '.forwar~:at that point. How~ver, the 
record does not supbort pe~itioneJ~s-claim. The transc~ipt 1·shows 
that after the petitioner was infJtrne~ that the panei would not 
consider evidence on the al~~ge~ lode violations by respon~ent, I ; I ' . . · · 
petitioner w·as._given the opportunity· to deciine to proceed with 
I 
the arbitration and pursue the:ca~e in whatever forum she 
desired. The :arbitraitors simply sJated that if there was going to 
I . I 
:i 
be a fee arbitration in the First Judicial District, it was to . . 
I take .place. that day. : . I 
Petitioiier argues that §136 .. '1. should have been invoked based 
I 
on the legal:issues she raised. (It should be noted that she does 
not appear to have brought to the.attention of the arbitrators 
! the issue regarding refunding paym~nts, which she now cites as 
6 [* 6]
~:r·":'"'"""-·--- -··-·- • --·--·-.- ·-·--··-~·----;------- •r-: ·~ '"""'""·-·M-.·-------- -···-; 
r I 
.I critical.) It may well be that this is· a case in which §136. 4 
could properly have been invoked as a matter of discretion. 
It does not follow that the course actually taken ·by the 
arbitrators was either improper or ;to petitioner's disadvantage. 
Again, fee arbitration is the right-of the client. It is intended 
to provide the client with a forum in which fee disputes can be 
resolved in a streamlined and equitable manner. It is the forum 
which petition~r elected for this case. Deqlining.to accept the 
case 
What '. 
I • would have meant rejecting petitioner's choice of forum. 
i 
I the arbitrators did instead was to inform petitioner what 
issues would not be covered and give her the choice of proceeding 
with the arbitration or seeking another forum. It -is difficult· to 
I : • 
see how this leaves, petitioner wit'h cause for compl·aint. 
Petitione~ als6 contends thati :the arbitrators failed to 
. I I ' : . . 
allow her; to !lresen~ evide1c,e as +qui.~ed . by §136. H?weVer; ,. her 
affidavit · establishes only that the arbitrators cut her off at . . I certain points of her presentatio~. §136 does not give the client 
I . . . .I the unlimited right to present ev~dence. Petitioner's affid~vjt 
indicates that, among other th~ngs, she was allowed to submit 
voluminous d~cume~tary evidence covering all the issues she 
' 
wished to: raise ±ri her oral p;esentation. Her allegation that the 
arbitrato:rs.ciid not consider any of the. documentary evidence is 
mere speculation and would require a presumption of irregularity 
that this: court is not entitled to ·make. From·the discussion 
shown on the transcript, it is apparent that the panel had read 
and carefully considered petitioner's submissions to that point.

Since I do not find grounds to vacate or modify the 
arbitration award, the petition's motion is here~y denied. 
Accordingly, under CPLR §§7510 and 75ll(e), respondent's motion 
to confirm the award must be grant.ep.. Wherefore it is 
ORDERED .that the fee arbitration award dated October 1, 1998; 
is confirmed; and it is further 
. ORDERED an9 ADJUDGED that Susah Hoag, having an· address at . 
325 Greenwich Avenue, Greenwich CT 06830 shall have judgment and 
recover against Lyn~ Mordas, having ! an address at Indian Lake 
Road, Millerton, NY ·12546 in the amount of $20,000. 
This constitutes the decision, order and ju.dgment of this 
court.
