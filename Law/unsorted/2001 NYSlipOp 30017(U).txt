ORDERED that the plaintiff, Island Holding LLC’s motion for an order confirming the 
report of sale and directing the Suffolk County Treasurer to distribute the surplus monies, and the 
cross motion of claimant, The Union Illinois (1995) Investment Limited Partnership, also for an 
order directing the Suffolk County Treasurer to distribute the surplus monies deposited on account 
of the foreclosure sale in this action are determined as follows: 
This is an action to foreclose on a mortgage held by the plaintiff on real property located 
at P.O. Box 5 16, Fishers Island, Suffolk County, New York. Pursuant to a Judgment ofForeclosure 
and Sale of this Court entered on June 20,2000, the referee herein, Patricia Moore, Esq., sold said 
property on July 27,2000 to the plaintiff as the highest bidder in the amount of $3,200,000.00. That 
after such sale and the disposal of the proceeds, there remained a surplus in the amount of 
$1,377,948.03. The referee retained $1,245.00 in her escrow account for the cost of her escrow 
account bank processing fees ($45 .OO) and the balance for which she would be seeking additional 
fees as referee due to the substantial time incurred on fufilling her duties. On September 22,2000 
surplus monies in the amount of $1,376,703.03 were forwarded to the Suffolk County Treasurer 
fo deposit. 
The plaintiff, Island Holding is the owner of a second mortgage lien, in the amount of 
$1,500,000.00, dated January 13, 1989 which was issued to George Harrison by the titled owner, 
Denis O’Brien. Said mortgage was assigned by Harrison to Island Holding by assignment of [* 2 ]

Page Three 
mortgage dated July 25,2000. Claimant, The Union Illinois (1 995) Investment Limited Partnership 
(“UIILP”) is a successor in interest by assignment to the rights of defendant Allegiant Bank and is 
the owner of two mortgage liens: one mortgage dated June 5,1995 in the amount of $423,997.15 
and the second dated June 14, 1995 in the amount of $480,767.22 . “UIILP” has asserted that 
Island Holding’s second mortgage acquired from Harrison does not constitute a valid mortgage. 
The original mortgage issued to George Harrison dated January 13, 1989, was recorded 
in the Suffolk County Clerk’s Office on April 24, 1995. Island Holding asserts that mortgage was 
issued in consideration of a loan to be procured and guaranteed by Harrison for the benefit of 
Handmade Films, a partnership formed by O’Brien and Harrison. On February 22,1989, O’Brien 
executed a “counter indemnity” where he specifically agreed to be liable to Harrison for one half 
the loan from British and Commonwealth Bank guaranteed by Harrison. A loan in the amount of 
$5,250,000.00 was obtained and Harrison refinanced the entire amount through American Express 
Bank. O’Brien has failed to make any payments under the mortgage or counter indemnity. 
“UIILP” has asserted that aforesaid mortgage did not secure a liquidated sum advanced 
by Harrison to O’Brien but was solely to secure a potential obligation that may become due to a 
third party who was not directly involved in the mortgage arrangement. The purpose of the 
mortgage is specifically set forth on page one of the document which was partially altered by 
handwritten changes: [* 3 ]

WITNESSETH that to secure payment of a possible indebtedness in 
the sum of One Million Five Hundred ($1,500,000.00) lawful money 
of the United States, to be paid according to a certain bond, note or 
obligation with the British and Commonwealth Bank of approximately 
US $6,000,000 (the “Note”), the Mortgagor hereby mortgages to the 
Mortgagee and grants to the Mortgagee a security interest ...... 
“There can be no doubt as to the validity of mortgages to secure future advances or 
liabilities as this has become a recognized form of security frequently used in the transaction of 
business (Ackerman v. Hunsicker, 85 N.Y. 43,47; Knapv v. McGowan, 96 N.Y. 75,86, supra ; 
3A Warren’s Weed, New York Real Property, Mortgages, 0 1.05; Rasch, Real Property Law and 
Practice, 5 1702).” (W.L. Developement Corp. v. Trtfort Real@, Inc. et al, 44 N.Y.2d 489,406 
N.Y.S.2d 437,442 [ 19781). The absence of a bond or note is not fatal to the validity of a mortgage 
because such bond or note is not the actual consideration, but merely evidence of the obligation. 
(KawaiAmerican Corp. v. Hilton, 205 A.D.2d 1021, 613 N.Y.S.2d 989 [3rd Dept. 19941). The 
claimant “U1ILP”’s cross motion to direct the payment of its outstanding lien on such grounds is, 
as such, denied. [* 4 ]

At issue, however, is whether the debt secured by the Harrison mortgage was previously 
satisfied. Accordingly, a hearing is directed to be held on April 24, 2001 at 9:30 am before this 
Court for such limited purpose. Decision is reserved with regard to the remaining claimants and 
the order of priority as to any and all other outstanding liens. 
Settle order.
