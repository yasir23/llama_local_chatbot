ORDERED that this motion by defendant K.K.S. HOME REMODELERS INC. (“KKS”) and the 
cross motion by defendant COLONIAL CENTRE COMPANY (“CCC”) each seeking an order pursuant to 
CPLR 93212 granting summaryjudgment dismissingplaintiff s complaint and all cross claims against them 
are determined as follows: 
On March 27, 1998 plaintiff JOSEPH MlRANDO (“MIRANDO”) claims that he fell on a plywood 
ramp on premises owned by defendant “CCC”. “MIRANDO” used the ramp as an entranceway to his office. 
Under the terms of a December, 1997 agreement between “CCC” and defendant “KKS”, “KKS” installed 
a new handicap ramp and subfloor. “KKS” claims the ramp was completed sometime in January, 1998. 
Defendant “KKS’s” motion seeks an order granting summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs 
complaint and all cross claims against it claiming that no legal basis exists upon which movant can be found 
liable for plaintiffs injuries. In support, movant submits two affirmations of counsel which recite relevant 
portions ofthe parties deposition testimony. Defendant claims that “KKS” employees properly installed the 
new handicap ramp and no evidence exists to prove that an alleged hole existed in the plywood at the time 
of installation or to show that the plywood was otherwise defective. Movant asserts that “KJSS’s” work 
conformed to the owner’s specifications and was deemed satisfactory after inspection by the town building 
inspector and by “CCC’s” agents. It is defendant’s position that no relevant, admissible evidence exists to [* 1 ]RE: MIRANDO v. COLONIAL CENTRE COMPANY 
Index #26995- 1998 
Page 2 
support plaintiffs claims that the plywood lacked structural integrity and therefore plaintiffs complaint and 
all cross claims against “KKS” must be dismissed. 
In support of its cross motion for summary judgment, defendant “CCC” submits an attorney’s 
affirmation and claims that plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence against “CCC”. 
Movant contends that no proof exists to show that “CCC” either created or had actual or constructive notice 
of the claimed dangerous condition which caused “MIRANDO’S” injuries. Defendant claims that absent 
such proof, plaintiffs complaint must be dismissed. 
In opposition to both motions, plaintiff submits an affidavit, two affidavits from a licensed 
professional engineer, affidavits from two “CCC” employees and from a witness who saw plaintiff fall 
together with two affirmations of counsel. Plaintiff claims that substantial issues of fact exist concerning 
the negligence of the defendant/contractor “KKS” and the defendanuowner “CCC” proximately causing his 
injuries. Plaintiffs expert claims that the plywood installed by “KKS” had wood knots which were not 
properly treated and secured. Plaintiff claims that defendant failed to adequately treat the plywood causing 
it to perforate and create a depression in the surface where plaintiff fell. It is plaintiffs position that 
significant questions of fact exist under these circumstances sufficient to defeat defendants applications. - 
CPLR $3212(b) states that the motion for summary judgment “shall be supported by affidavit, by 
a copy of the pleadings and by other available proof, such as depositions and written admission.” If an 
attorney lacks personal knowledge of the events giving rise to the cause of action or defense, his ancillary 
affidavit, repeating the allegations or the pleadings, without setting forth evidentiary facts, cannot support 
or defeat a motion by summary judgment (OLAN v. FAFUELL LINES, INC., 105 AD 2d 653,481 NYS 
2d 370 (1st Dept., 1984; affd 64 NY 2d 1092,489 NYS 2d 884 (1985); SPEARMAN v. TIMES SOUARE 
STORES COW., 96 AD 2d 552,465 NYS 2d230 (2ndDept., 1983); Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NEW YORK 
CIVIL PRACTICE Sec. 3212.09)). Moreover, it is well settled that aparty opposing amotion for summary 
judgment must assemble, lay bare and reveal his proof in order to establish that the matters set forth in his 
pleadings are real and capable ofbeing established (CASTRO v. LIBERTY BUS CO., 79 AD 2d 1014,435 
NYS 2d 340 (2nd Dept., 1981). 
In order to establish tort liability the plaintiff must demonstrate the existence and breach of a duty 
owed to him by the defendant (PALKA v. EDELMAN, 40 NY2d 781, 390 (NYS2d 393 (1976); 
PALSGRAF v. LIRR CO., 248 NY 339 (1928); Prosser, “Torts” 4 Edition $30, 41-42 and 53)). He must 
hrther demonstrate that defendants’ acts or omissions which constituted such breach were aproximate cause 
of plaintiff’s injuries (SHEEHAN v. CITY OF NEW YORK, 40 NY2d 496,387 NYS2d 92 (1976)). 
A landowner owes a duty to another on his land to keep it in a reasonably safe condition (BARS0 
v. MILLER, 40 NY2d 233,241,386 NYS 2d 564 (1976); SMITH v. TAYLOR, -AD 2d -, 719 NYS 
2d 686 (2d Dept., 2001)). A party who possesses real property either as an owner or a tenant, is under a duty 
to exercise reasonable care to maintain that property in a safe condition, and this duty includes the [* 2 ]RE: MIRANDO v. COLONIAL CENTRE COMPANY 
Index #26995-1998 
Page 3 
undertaking of minimal precautions to protect members of the public from the reasonably foreseeable acts 
of third persons (MARTINEZ v. SANTORO, - AD 2d -, 710 NYS 374 (2d Dept., 2000); SADLER v. 
TOWNOFHURLEY, - AD 2d -, 720 NYS 2d 613 (3rd Dept., 2001). 
Liability for a dangerous condition on property is predicated upon occupancy, ownership, control 
or a special use of such premises. The existence of one or more of these elements is sufficient to give rise 
to a duty of care. Where none is present, a party cannot be held liable for injury caused by the defective or 
dangerous condition of the property (BALSAM v. DELMA ENGINEERTNG COW., 139 AD 2d 292,296- 
297 (1” Dept., 1988) leave to appeal denied, 73 NY2d 783 (1989); PAPPALARDO v. NY HEALTH & 
RACKETCLUB, - AD 2d -, 718 NYS 2d 287 (lst Dept., 2000). 
In a slip and fall case a plaintiff may only recover when he is able to show that the defendant either 
created the condition which caused the accident or had actual or constructive notice of the condition 
(ANDERSON v. KLEIN’S FOODS, 139 AD2d 904 (4th Dept., 1988), aff d 73 NY2d 835 (1989); MOSS 
v. JNK CAPITAL, 21 1 AD2d 769,621 NYS2d 679 (2d Dept., 1995)). Constructive notice maybe inferred 
where the alleged defect was visible and apparent for a sufficient length of time prior to the accident so ‘as 
to permit the defendant to discover and remedy it (GORDON v. AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL- 
HISTORY, 67 NY2d 836 (1986); FASOLINO v. FASHION BUG, 7,7 NY2d 847,567 NYS2d 640 (1991)). 
Based upon the submission of evidence by the parties, substantial issues of fact exist concerning 
defendants negligence sufficient to require a plenary trial. Defendants motions for summary judgment must 
therefore be denied. Accordingly, it is 
ORDERED that defendant “KKS’s” motion and defendant “CCC’s” cross motion each seeking an 
order pursuant to CPLR $3212 granting summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint and all cross 
claims against them are denied.
