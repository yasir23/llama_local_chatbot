Robert G. Main Jr., J.
<P><B><P>DECISION AND ORDER
<font color="FF0000">[*2]</font></B><P><B>MAIN, JR., J. </B>In this unique proceeding,
pursuant to Highway Law &sect;&sect; 300 <I>et seq.</I>, petitioner sought to have a jury of
property owners determine the necessity for a private road being cut out of respondents' private
property for petitioner's benefit. More specifically, petitioner applied to have a private roadway,
fifty (50) feet wide, laid out over, and within, an existing private roadway owned by respondents
for the benefit of an allegedly "landlocked" parcel of real property known as the Hutchinson Lot.
Upon completion of the hearing, and after due deliberation, the jury found that the proposed road
was not necessary (see, Highway Law &sect; 301).
<P>Petitioner contends that the jury decision was contrary to the weight of the evidence as well
as contrary to law. As such, petitioner now moves, pursuant to Highway law &sect; 312, to
vacate and set aside the jury determination, and, in the alternative, petitioner appeals from the
jury determination. Petitioner further argues that this court should direct judgment in its favor.
Respondents oppose the relief requested and have cross-moved for an order either vacating the
decision of the jury pursuant to Highway law &sect; 312 and declaring the entire proceeding a
nullity or confirming the jury decision. In determining this application, the court has reviewed
and considered the affidavits and affirmations of counsel, the "Record on Appeal:, and counsels'
legal memoranda.
<P>There is no question that this court has jurisdiction to entertain the applications, with the
exception of the "appeal" (see, Highway Law &sect; 312). As can be seen upon brief review, the
statute and related case law provide very little guidance for the court. The statute confers upon
this court the authority to decide this application upon such terms "as it shall deem just and legal"
(Highway Law &sect; 312). There has been only one reported case in the past one hundred years
considering the scope of review of a County Court decision pursuant to Highway Law &sect; 312
after a jury determination pursuant to what is now Highway Law &sect; 301 (see, <I>Towner v
Schoenthal</I>, 120 AD2d 931). A review of that case indicates its failure to assist the court in
any meaningful way with respect to the standard of review. As a result, the court has more
discretion than it often enjoys to accomplish justice, as there are no hard and fast precedents
compelling a certain interpretation or conclusion.
<P>As a preliminary matter, the court will consider only the motion and cross motion, as there is
no provision for an "appeal" from such a determination. Furthermore, since respondents were
successful at the proceeding, and petitioner's application was denied by the jury, the court
declines to consider respondents' motion to vacate the jury determination and declare the entire
proceeding a nullity. The functions of this court do not include determining potential future
controversies which may or may not ever become ripe for determination. In the absence of a
concrete justiciable controversy, there is nothing for the court to determine (see, <I>New York
Public Interest Research Group v. Carey</I>, 42 NY2d 527; <I>Employers' Fire Insurance
Company v. Klemons</I>, 229 AD2d 513, <I>King v. Glass, </I>223 AD2d 708). Since
respondents prevailed at the hearing, they are not aggrieved parties such that they may seek
vacatur of the jury determination.
<P>Petitioner makes three arguments in support of its motion. First, petitioner alleges that the
<font color="FF0000">[*3]</font>unrefuted proof before the jury established that the
Hutchinson Lot was, and is, "landlocked". Second, petitioner asserts that the opening of a private
road is necessary for the beneficial enjoyment of the Hutchinson Lot. Finally, petitioner contends
that the unrefuted proof at the hearing established that the opening of a private roadway for the
benefit of the Hutchinson Lot would cause respondents to suffer no damages.
<P>As petitioner correctly states, the right of an individual to seek the opening of a private road
is guaranteed by the New York Constitution. (<I>see</I>, Article I, &sect; 7 [c]). However, no
allegation has been made that this right was, in any way, abridged in this proceeding which was
conducted in accordance with the statute. Petitioner's responding affidavit alleges that
respondents were afforded both procedural and substantive due process in the matter and that the
procedures set forth in the Highway Law were correctly followed. Presumably, petitioner was
afforded the same due process. As such, petitioner's only complaint appears to be that the jury,
upon consideration of the appropriate evidence, reached the wrong conclusion. Noticeably absent
from petitioner's motion papers is any legal authority suggesting that the jury did, in fact, reach
the wrong conclusion. The cases cited by petitioner concern common law causes of action related
to easements, rights of way, or adverse possession, not the statutory procedure of Highway Law
&sect;&sect; 300 <I>et seq.</I>
<P>Petitioner contends that the Hutchinson Lot was, and is, landlocked with no access to any
town road. While this may currently be true, the evidence introduced at the proceeding
established that petitioner did, during the mid-1980's, own contiguous parcels of land connecting
the Hutchinson Lot to the public portion of the Kildare Road in the Town of Altamont.
Petitioner's counsel stipulated to this fact on the record. Petition thereafter caused the Hutchinson
Lot to become landlocked by voluntarily conveying certain surrounding tracts of land to Danial
M. Christmas and The Nature Conservancy and by failing to reserve an easement or right of way
through those properties for the benefit of the Hutchinson Lot. If the use of respondents' private
portion of the Kildare Road is now necessary, petitioner created this problem. Since petitioner
could have built a road providing access from the town road to the Hutchinson Lot, the company
should not be allowed to take over a roadway owned by others simply for reasons of expediency
and economics when other alternatives existed.
<P>Furthermore, petitioner currently owns the property adjoining the 4,479 foot private portion
of the Kildare Road which runs in a northerly direction from the end of the public portion of the
Kildare Road. Awarding ownership of that portion of the private roadway is clearly unnecessary
under any circumstance, since petitioner could build a parallel roadway on its own property to get
to approximately the same location.
<P>It is undisputed that respondents have consistently given petitioner permission to use the
private portion of the Kildare Road, currently in existence, to access the Hutchinson Lot. No
evidence was introduced suggesting that petitioner had ever attempted to negotiate with
respondents for the purchase of a right of way over the private roadway. While petitioner asserts
that permission to use the roadway does not eliminate necessary as a matter of law, no authority
<font color="FF0000">[*4]</font>is cited supporting such a conclusion. While it may be
possible that some other type of cause of action would allow a court to compel respondents to
permit petitioner to use the private portion of the Kildare Road, nothing in the statutory structure
of Article XI of the Highway Law requires, or even sanctions, such a result.
<P>To the extent that certain objections were made at the proceeding relating to the introduction
of evidence and to certain comments made by counsel, the court is not inclined to revise such
objections specifically. The statutory procedure set forth in Article XI contemplates a proceeding
far less formal than a small claims hearing in justice court where the standard of review upon
appeals is whether substantial justice has been accomplished between the parties (<I>see</I>,
Uniform Justice Courts Act &sect; 1807). Normal rules of practice, procedure, pleading, and
evidence are not binding, and disclosure is generally unavailable at such hearings (<I>see,
</I>Uniform Justice Court Act &sect; 1804). The court considers it appropriate to apply a similar
standard of review in this matter.<I>
</I><P>Upon consideration of all the issues raised in petitioner's motion and respondents
cross-motion, the court finds no reason to upset the determination reached by the jury. Since this
court concludes that petitioner failed to establishthe requisite "necessity" for the opening of the
private roadway, there is no need for any discussion with respect to the issue of damages.
<P>For the reasons set forth herein, it is
<P><B>ORDERED</B> that petitioner's "appeal", as designated, be and the same hereby is,
dismissed; and it is further
<P><B>ORDERED</B> that petitioner's application to vacate and/or set aside the jury decision
be, and the same hereby is, denied; and it is further
<P><B>ORDERED</B> that respondents' cross-motion to vacate the jury determination and
declare the entire proceeding a nullity be, and the same hereby is, denied; and it is further
<P><B>ORDERED</B> that respondents' cross-motion to confirm the decision of the jury be,
and the same hereby is, granted, and the decision of the jury is, in all respects, confirmed.
