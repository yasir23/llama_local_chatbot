LUBELL, J.  
This medical malpractice action is brought in conne ction with, among other things, 
personal injuries including brain damage, cerebral palsy, hemiparesis, blindness, and 
cognitive and developmental delays allegedly suffer ed by the infant plaintiff, Mario 
Emmanual Santana (the “Infant”), during and directl y after his birth. 1  
Currently before the Court  is the motion in limine of Paul S. Mayer, M.D. (“Mayer”), 
as joined in by co-defendant Yessin Ashmawy, M.D., for an ORDER precluding the 
introduction at trial of evidence or references to the administrative proceedings, findings 
and/or determination of The New York State Board Fo r Professional Medical Conduct (the 
“Board”) with respect to Mayer and his subsequent c onviction for Attempted Unauthorized 
Practice of Medicine.   For the reasons herein stat ed, the Court grants the motion except 
to the extent that Mayer may be cross-examined for impeachment purposes with respect 
to the Board’s sustained specifications against May er for fraudulent practice (Education 
Law §6530 [2]) and his conviction for Attempted Una uthorized Practice of Medicine, as is 
more fully set forth herein.  
1 The action has since been dismissed as against defe ndant Prabhakar Kocherlakota, M.D. .
1[* 1]
At all times relevant to the allegations underlying  this action, including Torres' 
prenatal care and the ensuing delivery on October 1 5, 1997, Mayer was a board certified 
obstetrician/gynecologist  licensed as a physician in the State of New York since July 1976. 
At the time of this incident, Mayer, co-defendant Y essin Ashmawy, M.D. ("Ashmawy"), and 
non-party Nurse Midwife Laura Cross (the "Midwife")   were employed by Hudson Valley 
Obstetrics & Gynecology, P.C. ("Hudson Valley"), a professional corporation owned by 
Mayer.  
Plaintiff Sandra Torres (“Torres”), the Infant’s mo ther, contends that from August 
1997 until the time of the Infant’s delivery on Oct ober 15, 1997 she had been leaking 
amniotic fluid.  During that interval and during th e course of the delivery at defendant St. 
Luke's Hospital, Torres alleges to have been cared for by Dr. Paul S. Mayer, M.D.  Torres 
claims that Mayer’s failure to have diagnosed and t reated the leakage of amniotic fluid 
resulted in the injuries sustained by the Infant.  Torres also claims that her labor and the 
delivery of the Infant were mismanaged in that, amo ng other things, a cesarean section 
should have been performed.  
As set forth at Item "2" of the plaintiffs’  respon se to Mayer’s  Demand for a Bill of 
Particulars, the allegations of alleged negligence as to Mayer and Hudson Valley concern 
the prenatal care of the Torres from April 8, 1997 through October 15, 1997 and the 
ensuing labor and delivery of the Infant on October  15, 1997 at defendant St. Luke's 
Hospital.   More particularly as set forth therein,  plaintiffs claim that Mayer: 
1. failed to diagnose premature/prolonged rupture o f the 
membranes during the plaintiff's prenatal visits; 
2. failed to treat oligohydraminos (inadequate amni otic fluid) caused by the 
premature/prolonged rupture of the membranes; 
3.failed to maintain proper medical records; 
4. failed to diagnose and treat fetal distress; and , 
5. failed to perform a timely cesarean section. 
In contrast to the position taken by plaintiffs wit h respect to Mayer’s participation in 
the care and treatment of Torres and the Infant, Ma yer contends that all medical care 
pertinent to this matter during August 1997 had bee n provided by the Midwife and, 
thereafter, solely by co-defendant Ashmawy. 
In anticipation of having to testify at trial to ad dress, among other things, the material 
questions of fact as to whether and to what extent he was involved with the care and 
2[* 2]
treatment of Torres and the delivery of the Infant,  Mayer brings this motion in connection 
with the September 15, 2000 determination of the Bo ard to revoke his medical license 
following a five-day hearing conducted pursuant to the provisions of Section 230 (10) of 
the New York Public Health Law and Sections 301-307  and 401 of the New York State 
Administrative Procedure Act. In connection therewi th, the Board received evidence 
concerning fifteen “specifications” of Mayer’s alle ged violations of Section 6530 of the New 
York State Education Law concerning the medical car e and treatment provided by Mayer 
to three of his patients, identified therein as Pat ients “A”, “B” and “C”, during the period 
from 1995 through 1997, neither of whom were Torres  or the Infant.  The hearing was 
conducted between April 12, 2000 and June 13, 2000.  
The fifteen specifications alleged gross negligence  (Education Law §6530 [4],  gross 
incompetence (Education Law §6530[6]), negligence ( Education Law §6530[3]), 
incompetence (Education Law §6530 [5]), failure to keep adequate patient records 
(Education Law § 6530 [32],  fraudulent practice (E ducation Law §6530 [2]), conduct which 
evidences moral unfitness (Education Law §6530 [20] ), and the inappropriate delegation 
of professional responsibilities (Education Law §65 30 [25]).  
The specifications included allegations that: on Ju ly 12, 1995, Mayer performed a
hysterectomy without the benefit of a frozen sectio n study intra-operatively (laboratory 
evaluation for the presence of cancer cells), there by causing the sterility of the patient 
where subsequent pathology reports showed no cancer ; and, on June 11, 1997, Mayer 
performed a voluntary termination of a pregnancy (a bortion) of a fetus at the twenty-six to 
twenty-eight week gestational age without having fi rst clinically or diagnostically established 
the correct gestational age of the fetus, thereby r esulting in an illegal abortion.  With 
respect to the latter determination, the Board conc luded that Mayer made false statements 
to other medical care providers about the source of  the patient and the presence of 
fibroids. 
Upon completion of the hearing, the Board “found nu merous violations of accepted 
standards of medicine and each violation constitute d either gross negligence or gross 
incompetence” such as to form the basis for the Boa rd’s revocation of Mayer’s license 
(Matter of Paul S. Mayer, M.D. , 2000 WL35364496).   Revocation was deemed appropr iate 
even though the specifications relating to Patient “C” were not sustained, “the most serious 
acts, those associated with patient “A”, [had] happ ened 3 years [before their determination] 
and those acts associated with Patient “B” [had tak en] place 5 years [before their 
determination]” (id. ). The Board further justified license revocation b y noting, “Not only did 
Respondent practice grossly substandard medicine, h e lied about it then and he continues 
to lie about it today” (id .)  In that regard, the Board further found: 
[Mayer] refuses to admit he lied to the hospital st aff about the 
referral of Patient A and the alleged performance o f the 
non-existing sonogram. The Committee could be more lenient 
with a practitioner who, in the heat of catastrophe , makes 
representations that are false. Yet Respondent cont inues to 
defend the indefensible. 
(Matter of Paul S. Mayer, M.D. , supra ). 
3[* 3]
The revocation of Mayer's medical license was tempo rarily stayed pending his 
appeal of the Board's determination to the Appellat e Division, Third Department.  The stay 
was subsequently vacated, and then reinstated.  By decision dated November 29, 2001, 
the Appellate Division, Third Department, reversed and annulled the Board’s determination 
(see , Matter of Mayer v. Novello , 288 A.D. 2d 780 [3rd Dept., 2001][determination a nnulled 
due to improperly constituted hearing committee; re mitted for a new hearing before a 
properly constituted one]) and remitted the matter for a de novo hearing.  Following an 
appeal of the Appellate Division determination, the  Court of Appeals reversed and remitted 
the action to the Appellate Division to consider th e balance of the issues initially raised on 
appeal (Matter of Mayer v. Novello , 99 N.Y.2d 180 [2002]).  By decision dated March 2 7, 
2003, the Appellate Division confirmed the Board's determination revoking Mayer's medical 
license  (Matter of Mayer v. Novello , 303 A.D. 2d 909  [3rd Dept., 2003]). 
In the meantime, on February 12, 2002, Mayer was in dicted and charged with the 
Unauthorized Practice of Medicine in violation of s ection 6512(1) of the Education Law, 
a class E non-violent felony.  More specifically, M ayer was charged with having practiced 
medicine without a license from November 24 to Dece mber 1, 2000 and on April 12, 2001 
and June 9, 2001 while his license had been revoked .  The asserted periods followed 
Mayer’s license revocation, the stay of the revocat ion, but then the reinstatement of the 
license  revocation pending the Appellate Division' s determination of the appeal.    
The County Court of the Count of Orange (DeRosa, J. ) dismissed the indictment 
upon its finding that Mayer had not received adequa te notice that the stay had been lifted. 
The Appellate Division, Second Department, reversed  the determination and reinstated the 
indictment finding that the evidence before the Gra nd Jury was sufficient to sustain the 
charge.  Thereafter, in April 2004, Mayer entered a  plea of guilty to one count of 
Attempted Unauthorized Practice of Medicine in viol ation of 110/6512 of the Education 
Law, an unclassified misdemeanor, putting to rest a ny notice issues that Mayer could have 
raised at trial. 
“A general rule of evidence, applicable in both civ il and criminal cases, is that it is 
improper to prove that a person did an act on a par ticular occasion by showing that he did 
a similar act on a different, unrelated occasion [c itation omitted]” (Matter of Brandon's 
Estate ,  55 N.Y.2d 206, 210-211 [1982]).  Certain excepti ons to this rule, none of which are 
advanced here, have been recognized where, for exam ple, the evidence of other similar 
acts is offered to help establish motive, intent,  absence of mistake or accident,  a common 
scheme or plan, or identity (Matter of Brandon's Es tate ,  supra ., citing  People v. Molineux ,
168 N.Y. 264, 293 [1901]).   
As such, Mayer’s application to preclude the introd uction at trial of evidence or 
references to the administrative proceedings, findi ngs or determination of the New York 
State Board For Professional Medical Conduct is gra nted to the extent that such 
proceedings, findings and determinations relate to the sustained specifications of gross 
negligence, gross incompetence, negligence, incompe tence, and the failure to keep 
adequate patient records.  
However, keeping in mind “the elementary premise th at impeachment is a particular 
form of cross-examination whose purpose is, in part , to discredit the witness and to 
4[* 4]
persuade the fact finder that the witness is not be ing truthful” (People v. Walker , 83 N.Y.2d 
455, 461 [1994] citing  Fisch, New York Evidence § 447 [2d ed.] ), the Cou rt concludes 
that, upon cross-examination of Mayer, reference ma y be made to the administrative 
proceedings, findings and determination of the Boar d to the extent said administrative 
proceedings, findings and determination relate to t he sustained findings of fraudulent 
practice (Education Law §6530 [2]) as were sustaine d in connection with the Eleventh and 
Twelfth Specifications of the Board’s determination .  More particularly, as to Specification 
Eleven, the Board found that, with the purpose of a ttempting to reduce his own 
responsibility, Mayer falsely represented to other medical personnel that a patient had 
been referred to him by another doctor so as to hav e hospital medical staff believe that he 
had come upon the patient when she was already in d istress, rather than having to take 
the responsibility for the truth of his actions.  A s to Specification Twelve, the Board found 
that Mayer represented to hospital medical staff th at a sonogram had been performed on 
a patient, when he knew that such was not true in a n attempt to reduce his culpability.  
“‘[P]racticing the profession fraudulently’ involve s the intentional misrepresentation 
or concealment of a known fact without the requirem ent that the fraud caused an injury to 
a patient or a benefit to the doctor (Mayer v. Nove llo , supra  at p. 910, citing   Matter of 
Schwalben v. DeBuono , 265 A.D.2d 609, 611 [3d Dept., 1999]; Matter of K im v Board of 
Regents of Univ. of State of N.Y. , 172 A.D.2d 880, 881-882 [3d Dept., 1991], lv  denied  78 
NY2d 856 [1991]).  Whether or not the sustained fin dings of fraudulent practice  constitute 
prior immoral, vicious or criminal conduct bearing on credibility, they may properly be used 
for impeachment purposes since, at the very least, they demonstrate an untruthful bent or 
willingness or disposition on Mayer’s part to volun tarily place his own self-interest and 
advancement ahead of principle or the interests of society (People v. Walker , at  461 citing 
People v. Coleman , 56 N.Y.2d 269, 273; People v. Sandoval , 34 N.Y.2d 371, 377 [1974]). 
“[T]he commission of crimes involving individual di shonesty, such as theft, fraud and 
forgery demonstrate [one’s] . . . willingness to pl ace [his] own interests ahead of the 
interests of society, thereby impacting directly up on the issue of . . . credibility” (People v
Young , 178 AD2d 571, 571-572 [2d Dept., 1991] [internal quotation marks omitted], 
quoting  People v Ortiz , 143 AD2d 107, 107 [2d Dept., 1988]).  The Board’s  sustained 
finding against Mayer of fraudulent practice is no different. 
Any consideration of the passage of time since the 2000 administrative proceedings, 
findings and determination and/or the 1995 to 1997 commission of the facts thereunder are 
sufficiently outweighed by the seriousness and rele vancy of the upheld Specifications and 
their proximity in time to the acts herein alleged.    
The Court now turns its attention to the one remain ing question: whether and to 
what extent Mayer’s conviction for Attempted Unauth orized Practice of Medicine and/or the 
facts thereunder may be employed at trial.    
 For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes t hat Mayer may be cross- 
examined with respect to the existence of his convi ction upon his plea of guilty for 
Attempted Unauthorized Practice of Medicine and the  underlying facts thereof . 
5[* 5]
In contrast to early common law under which the tes timony of a convicted criminal 
was rendered incompetent, CPLR §4513 provides as fo llows: 
A person who has been convicted of a crime is a com petent 
witness; but the conviction may be proved, for the purpose of 
affecting the weight of his testimony, either by 
cross-examination, upon which he shall be required to answer 
any relevant question, or by the record. The party 
cross-examining is not concluded by such person's a nswer. 
The authority granted to a civil litigant under CPL R §4513 to use an adverse 
witness’ criminal convictions to impeach his or her  credibility is “broad” (Vernon v. New 
York City Health and Hospitals Corp ., 167 A.D.2d 252 [1st Dept.,1990] citing  Able Cycle 
Engines v. Allstate Insurance Co. , 84 A.D.2d 140, 142-43 app . den ., 57 N.Y.2d 607 
[1982]).  “Under CPLR 4513, [both the] conviction o f a crime and the underlying facts of 
the criminal acts may be used to impeach the credib ility of a witness at a civil trial” (Dance 
v. Town of Southampton ,  95 A.D.2d 442, 453 [2d Dept., 1983] citing  Moore v. Leventhal ,
303 N.Y. 534 ; Able Cycle Engines v. Allstate Ins. Co. , supra ).  “While the nature and 
extent of such cross-examination is discretionary w ith the trial court . ., the inquiry must 
have some tendency to show moral turpitude to be re levant on the credibility issue . . . 
(Badr v. Hogan , 75 N.Y.2d 629 [1990] citing  Langley v. Wadsworth , 99 N.Y. 61, 63-64 
[1885]; People v. Montlake , 184 A.D. 578, 583 [2d Dept., 1918]; Richardson, E vidence §
499 [Prince 10th ed.]; Fisch, New York Evidence § 4 55 [2d ed.] ; see  also , Acunto v. 
Conklin , 260 A.D.2d 787, 789-790 [3d Dept., 1999][within t he sound discretion of Supreme 
Court to control the manner of presentation of proo f at trial especially when dealing with 
matters affecting a witness's credibility and accur acy]).   Certainly, one’s status as a 
physician is of no moment (see , Spanier v. New York City Transit Authority ,  222 A.D.2d 
219, 220 [1 st  Dept., 1995][proper for trial court to allow defen se to ask plaintiff's treating 
physician about prior allegations of improper billi ng, and other misconduct, since those 
allegations had a bearing on the doctor's credibili ty]). 
Subdivision (1) of section 6512 of the Education La w provides, in pertinent part: 
Anyone not authorized to practice under this title who practices 
or offers to practice or holds himself out as being  able to 
practice in any profession in which a license is a prerequisite 
to the practice of the acts, or who practices any p rofession as 
an exempt person during the time when his professio nal 
license is suspended, revoked or annulled . . . sha ll be guilty of 
a class E felony. 
Mayer’s conviction for Attempted Unauthorized Pract ice of Medicine, an unclassified 
misdemeanor, and the facts thereunder are highly re levant on the issue of Mayer’s 
credibility and sufficiently demonstrate his “willi ngness to deliberately further his 
self-interest at the expense of society” (People v.  McAleavey,  159 A.D.2d 646 2d Dept., 
1990]).  In addition, the conviction is not so remo te in time as to be precluded.

Co-defendant’s cross-motion is denied except to the  extent herein granted in

The rulings herein made will necessarily be the sub ject of limiting instructions to the
