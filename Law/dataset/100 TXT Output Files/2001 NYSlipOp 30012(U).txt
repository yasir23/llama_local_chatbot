ORDERED, that the motions and cross motion interposed herein 
are consolidated for decision; and it is further 
ORDERED, that the motion of the members of the Town Board of 
the Town of Huntington for judgment dismissing the action as 
asserted against them in their individual and official capacities 
(003) is granted upon the consent of the plaintiff, and the 
caption shall be amended accordingly; and it is further 
ORDERED, that the motion of the defendants Planning Board of 
the Town of Huntington and the individual members of the Planning 
Board for judgment dismissing the action as time-barred (004) is 
denied; and it is further 
ORDERED, that the cross motion of plaintiff to compel 
disclosure (005) is granted as follows. 
The action involves a 20-acre parcel of real property 
located within the Town of Huntington, and owned by plaintiff D & 
S Realty Development, LP. 
divided by a \\zone district boundary," with 10.7 acres zoned R-40 
(minimum lot size one acre, residential), and 9.8 acres 
previously zoned R-20 (minimum lot size 20,000 square feet, 
residential). It is alleged further that plaintiff sought the 
approval of the defendant Planning Board for the construction of 
seven homes in the R-40 zone and 17 additional homes in the R-20 
zone. After SEQRA review of plaintiff's proposal, which occurred 
over the course of more than two years, and after apparent public 
outcry over the proposed development, it appears that the 
defendant Planning Board rejected plaintiff's original 24-home 
plan and a modified 17-home plan, resolving that plaintiff submit 
a 12-home plan. Thereafter, the defendant Town Board rezoned the 
9.8 acre portion from R-20 to R-40, substantially reducing the 
number of homes which could be constructed on the parcel. It is alleged that the parcel is 
Plaintiff commenced this action pursuant to 42 USC ยง1983, 
seeking declaratory relief, as well as compensatory and punitive 
damages, for the alleged violation of its constitutional rights. 
Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that the defendants acted in bad 
faith; that they "unduly and intentionally delayed" the SEQRA 
process in furtherance of their \\ultimate intention" to rezone 
the parcel; that the rezoning was "illegal, arbitrary and 
capricious;" that the rezoning constituted an illegal taking 
without compensation, in violation of plaintiff's Fifth and 
Fourteenth Amendment rights; and that plaintiff was denied due 
process of law. [* 2 ]

Defendants Frank Petrone, Marlene L. Budd, Mark Cuthbertson, 
Steven J. Israel, and Susan J. Scarpati-Reilly, who were 
individual members of the Town Board at the times relevant to 
this action, move for summary judgment dismissing the complaint 
as asserted against them individually, on the ground that they 
enjoyed legislative immunity for any actions taken in their 
official capacity. 
defendants, and accordingly, the motion (003) is granted. Plaintiff consents to dismissal as to these 
The defendant Planning Board and the individual members 
thereof move for summary judgment dismissing the complaint in its 
entirety on the grounds that it is time-barred. 
Board defendants argue in support that the complaint is nothing 
more than an Article 78 proceeding which, pursuant to Town Law 
ยง282, must have been commenced no later than 30 days after the 
final decision of the Planning Board. Town Law 5282 in fact 
provides : The Planning 
Any person. . .aggrieved by any decision of 
the planning board concerning such plat or 
the changing of the zoning regulations of 
such land, or any officer, department, board 
or bureau of the town, may have the decision 
reviewed by a special term of the supreme 
court in the manner provided by article 
seventy-eight of the civil practice law and 
rules provided the proceeding is commenced 
within thirty days after the filing of the 
decision in the office of the board. 
... 
The Planning Board defendants argue that the Article 78 "remedy" 
for which this section provides is the exclusive manner by which 
the Planning Board's actions may be challenged. 
However, it has been held that '\[iln the context of land 
use, [42 USC] section 1983 provides protection against municipal 
actions which violate a landowner's rights under the Just 
Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment or the Due Process 
Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United 
States Constitution,'' as well as a "substantive due process claim 
based on arbitrary and capricious conduct" 
Magee, 88 NY2d 41, 49, 643 NYS2d 21 [19961). Hence, the 
complaint herein states a viable cause of action. (Town of Orangetown v [* 3 ]
D & S Realty v. Huntinston Index No. 2897/99 Pase 4 
Furthermore, plaintiff correctly argues that the applicable 
statute of limitations herein is three years, pursuant to New 
York's CPLR 214 (5) (cf. 423 South Salina Street, Inc. v City of 
Syracuse, 68 NY2d 474, 501 NYS2d 507 [1986]). As this action was 
commenced well within the three-year period, the motion of the 
Planning Board defendants must be denied. 
Finally, the cross motion to compel the individual Town 
Board members to appear for deposition is granted. Though they 
are no longer parties to this action, their testimony 
nevertheless remains crucially relevant to the claims alleged 
herein. 
Accordingly, Frank Petrone, Marlene L. Budd, Mark 
Cuthbertson, Steven J. Israel, and Susan J. Scarpati-Reilly are 
directed to appear for deposition on the lgth day of November, 
2001, at 9:30am, in the courthouse at 235 Griffing Avenue, 
Riverhead, and on each consecutive day thereafter on which court 
is in session, until depositions are completed. Depositions may, 
by agreement, be completed at an earlier date and time, and at 
another location. 
The compliance conference, previously scheduled on September 
13, 2001, is adjourned to November 29, 2001. 
Plaintiff is directed to forthwith serve the above-listed 
individual Board Members with a copy of this order, with notice 
of entry thereon, by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
Plaintiff shall serve a further copy of this order upon the 
calendar clerk of this court.
