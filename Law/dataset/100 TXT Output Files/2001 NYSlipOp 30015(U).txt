602408/1998 
Before me is a motion by plaintiff to extend the duration of a notice of 
pendency and a cross -motion by defendant to vacate the notice. 
A notice of pendency was filed in this action on May 15, 1998. Plaintiffs 
motion seeking an extension of the notice was served on August 15, 200 1. CPLR 
65 13 provides that a notice of pendency is effective for a period of three years, but 
that "before" the expiration of such period the court ''for good cause 'shown " may 
9 
extend the period. 
In light of the requirement that the extension application be made before the 
expiration of the three year period, it has been held that, absent a timely application, 
it is not only improper to grant an extension nunc pro tunc, but also a court may not [* 1 ]
grant permission for the filing of a new prospective notice. 
In Matter of Sakow, 182 
 Misc.2d 775 (SUIT. Ct., Bx. Co. 1999), the court, 
recognizing the impropriety of granting a nunc pro tunc extension of an expired 
notice, allowed the parties to file new notices that would "protect them prospectively 
from the date that the new order is filed, recorded, and indexed ". However, this 
permission was overturned on appeal [280 A.D.2d 678 
(2001)], the First Department 
ruling that since the notices expired without the affected parties having sought an 
extension, "they should not have been permitted to file new notices with respect to 
those properties'' (p. 379). In support of such holding, the court cited the Second 
Department decision in 
Slutsky v. Blooming Grove Inn, Inc., 147 A.D.2d 208 (1 989), 
where it was held that absent a timely extension, 
 tlsuccessive notices may not be filed 
for the purposes of CPLR article 65 and the plaintiff loses the special privilege 
afforded by that article " (p. 212). See also, Chuang v. Arguello, 143 Misc.2d 861 
(Sup. Ct., Kings Co. 1989). Thus, the motion of plaintiff for an extension is denied. 
Since the notice of pendency has expired, it is appropriate to now direct that 
it be canceled. See, Praver v. Remsen Associates, 18 1 A.D.2d 723 
(2nd*Dept. 1992); 1 
Modular Steel Systems, Inc. v. Avlis Contracting Corp., 89 A.D.2d 891 
(2nd Dept. 
1982). Accordingly, defendant's motion for a cancellation of the notice is granted. 
2 [* 2 ]
In the case at bar, the Appellate Division has upheld my finding that a triable 
issue of fact exists as to whether there is an enforceable contract (276 A.D.2d 295). 
In light of said appeal, which was decided in October 2000, and subsequent motion 
practice, this action is still not on the trial calendar. With the cancellation of the 
notice, a success of plaintiff in establishing the right to purchase the subject property 
can be rendered ineffective if the defendant subsequently sells the property to a bona 
fide purchaser. This would be unjust. 
It is noted that in Gallo Brothers Construction, Inc. v. Pecolo, 28 1 A.D.2d 8 1 
(2001), the Third Department implied, based on the discretion provided in CPLR 
2004, that if good cause were shown for the failure to seek a timely extension, such 
relief may be granted. However, there the plaintiff failed to offer any excuse for its 
inaction. Similarly here, if the court possessed discretion to grant an extension for 
good cause shown, plaintiffs motion would still be denied as it offered no 
explanation for its failure to timely move. 
In view of the foregoing, I would recommend an amendment to CPLR 65 13 to 
authorize a court for good cause shown to retroactively extend the period of an 
* 
expired notice of pendency, or at least be empowered to permit the filing of a new 
notice that would be prospective only, as was ruled by the lower court in Matter of 
Sakow, supra. Absent such a change, a purchaser from a defendant against whose 
i 
3 [* 3 ]
property a notice expired may end up in litigation as to whether the buyer had notice 
of claims of the plaintiff and was in fact a bona fide purchaser. 
The motion of defendant to dismiss plaintiffs claims for monetary damages is 
granted as plaintiff did not comply with the order dated June 18,2001 requiring that 
a bill of particulars be served with respect to its claim for reliance damages within 20 
days of service of such order, which order apparently was served on June 27,200 1. 
The bill of particulars apparently prepared and sent to the court after oral argument 
on October 19, without permission, was not considered. 
Lastly, the application of plaintiff to reargue the motion seeking to add Allan 
Reiver as a party plaintiff is denied as i) it is untimely [CPLR 2221 (d) 31 and ii) 
presents no argument that were not previously considered. 
Settle order.
