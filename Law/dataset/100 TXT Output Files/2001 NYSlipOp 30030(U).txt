Upon the following papers numbered 1- 32 read on these motions to stay action and for disqualification

Notice of Cross Motion and supporting papers -; Answering Affidavits and supporting papers 13 -19 ; Replying 
Affidavits and supporting papers 20 -22 ; Other 
 1-5;23-29;30-32 ; (and after hearing counsel in support and opposed 
to the motions) it is, 
ORDERED that this motion (#008) by defendant in Action No. 2 Town of Riverhead for 
for an order disqualifying and removing plaintiff Herbert Trent in his capacity in Action No. 2 as 
guardian of the infant plaintiffs therein and disqualifying counsel for plaintiffs therein is granted; 
and, it is further 
ORDERED that defendant in Action No. 2 Town of Riverhead is directed to serve a copy 
of this order on plaintiffs in Action No. 2 by certified mail, return receipt requested, within fifteen 
(15) days after its entry; and, it is further 
ORDERED that all proceedings in this action shall be stayed for sixty (60) days from the 
date of completion of service to permit plaintiffs in Action No. 2 to engage new counsel and to 
apply to this Court for the appointment 
 ofproper guardians for each infant plaintiff; and, it is further 
ORDERED that the Law Firm of Philip F. Alba, P.C. and the law firm of Broder & Reiter 
shall surrender the files of the instant action to incoming counsel upon request. 
These actions, joined for trial in 1991, arise from a motor vehicle accident occurring on 
October 17, 1989. It is alleged that a vehicle owned by plaintiff in Action No. 2 Herbert Trent and 
operated by Paulette A. Trent, in which the infant plaintiffs in Action No. 2 were passengers, 
collided with a vehicle owned by defendant in Action No. 2 Mary Boyd and operated by defendant 
in Action No. 2 Wayne E. Boyd on Middle Road near its intersection with Ostrander Avenue, in 
Riverhead, New York. A prior order of this Court, dated October 4, 2000, granted the motion of 
plaintiffs in Action No. 2 to amend their complaint to allege exceptions to Article 16 of the CPLR, 
and struck the affirmative defenses of defendant in Action No. 2 Town of Riverhead (defendant 
Town) alleging infant plaintiffs’ failure to use seat belts or other safety devices. On October 27, 
2000, defendant Town served a Notice of Appeal of said order to the Appellate Division of the 
Supreme Court, Second Department. A hearing was held on this matter before this Court on 
Thursday, January 1 1,2001. Defendant Town also brought a motion before the Appellate Division 
of the Supreme Court, Second Department to stay the instant action, which was denied by order 
dated January 18,200 1. 
Inasmuch as defendant Town’s motion for a stay was denied by the Appellate Division of 
the Supreme Court, Second Department, this Court will not entertain a request for the same relief. 
Defendant Town now moves to disqualify and remove plaintiff in Action No. 2 Herbert 
Trent, father of the infant plaintiffs, as their guardian on the grounds that his position as a vehicle [* 2 ]
Trent v Riverhead 
Index No. 92-6030 
Page 3 
owner under Vehicle and Traffic Law 
 0 388 creates a conflict of interest in that he may be required 
to collect a judgment against himself on behalf of the infant plaintiffs. In addition, defendant Town 
requests disqualification of plaintiffs’ attorneys, Philip F. Alba, P.C. and trial counsel, Broder & 
Reiter, Esqs., for their dual representation of plaintiff Herbert Trent and the infant plaintiffs based 
on their advice to discontinue the action as against defendant Paulette Trent, which resulted in a 
motion that was subsequently withdrawn. 
In opposition, plaintiffs in Action No. 2 contend that the request for disqualification is 
untimely and inappropriate as no conflict exists and counsel and guardian for the infant plaintiffs 
have represented the infant plaintiffs zealously; and that any disqualification at this juncture would 
be contrary to the best interests of the infant plaintiffs. In addition, plaintiffs in Action No. 2 
contend that this request is merely a delay tactic by defendant Town on the eve of trial inasmuch 
as defendant Town never considered plaintiff Herbert Trent as a viable or necessary defendant and 
did not commence any third -party action against plaintiff Herbert Trent for contribution, and that 
his potential liability for any judgment exceeding policy limits is speculative. 
The record reveals that plaintiff Herbert Trent has been guardian of the infant plaintiffs 
pursuant to CPLR 1201 for approximately 8 years (see, CPLR 1201), and that Philip F. Alba, P.C. 
has been the attorney of record for plaintiffs since November, 1992. The law firm of Broder & 
Reiter was retained as trial counsel in June, 2000. 
A parent may be removed as natural guardian if he or she has an interest adverse to the infant 
(see, Stahf v Rliee, 220 AD2d 39,643 NYS2d 148 [2d Dept. 19961) or failed to diligently represent 
the infant’s best interests (see, 
 Roserrberg v 
Roseitberg, 261 AD2d 623,690 NYS2d 693 [2d Dept. 
19991). Here, plaintiff Herbert Trent’s interest, as owner of the vehicle operated by defendant 
Paulette A. Trent, is adverse to that of the infant plaintiffs (see, Shaikli v Waiters, 185 Misc2d 52, 
7 10 NYS2d 873 [2000]) inasmuch as plaintiff Herbert Trent is vicariously liable pursuant to Vehicle 
and Traffic Law $388 for any negligence on the part of defendant Paulette A. Trent in her operation 
of the vehicle. Vehicle and Traffic Law $388 was enacted to ensure access by an injured party to 
a financially responsible defendant (see, Morris vsiiappy Car Rental, 84 NY2d 2 1,614 NYS2d 362 
[ 19941) and may be invoked only in actions brought by third persons against the owner (see, Miffs 
v Gabriel, 259 AD 60, 18 NYS2d 78 [2d Dept. 19401 
 a@ 284 NY 755 [1940]). The fact that the 
defendants in Action No. 2 did not commence a third -party action against Herbert Trent does not 
absolve an apparent conflict of interest in his continuing as the guardian of his children without 
pursuing any potential claim that the children may have against him under the Vehicle and Traffic 
Law $388 (cf: Mowczari v Bacon, 92 NY2d 281, 680 NYS2d 431 [1998]). So too, there is an 
apparent conflict of interest for in light of the injuries alleged there remains a possibility of a 
judgment in excess of the policy limits for which Herbert Trent may face liability. Therefore, 
plaintiff Herbert Trent must be discharged as the infant plaintiffs’ guardian and, pursuant to CPLR 
Article 12, proper guardians must be appointed by the Court on behalf of each infant plaintiff who 
shall not be either parent or their respective attorneys (see, Miiffiris v Saul, 130 AD2d 634, 5 15 [* 3 ]
Trent v Riverhead 
Index No. 92-6030 
Page 4 
NYS2d 561 [2d Dept. 19871). 
With respect to plaintiffs’ attorneys, since a child may properly bring an action against his 
or her parents, it is improper for an attorney to represent both the parents and the child in an 
automobile accident action brought against the owner and driver of the other vehicle (see, Sidor v 
Ziihoski, 261 AD2d 529, 690 NYS2d 637 [2d Dept. 19991). Indeed, because dual representation 
is fraught with the potential for irreconcilable conflict, it will rarely be sanctioned even after full 
disclosure has been made and the consent of clients obtained (see, Greeite v Creme, 47 NY2d 447, 
418 NYS2d 379 [1979]). This is especially so where the conflict extends to the very subject matter 
of the litigation (see, Greerie v Greene, supra). Moreover, a minor must be presumed to lack the 
ability to knowingly waive a conflict of interest (see, Matter of H. Childreti, 160 Misc2d 298,608 
NYS2d 784 [ 19941). 
Here, the nature of this action and the parties involved renders it improper for plaintiffs’ 
attorneys to represent the father Herbert Trent and his children, the infant plaintiffs (see, Sidor v 
Zirhoski, supra). The impropriety and potential for irreconcilable conflict is too strong to be 
ignored. Thus, under the circumstances of this case, the equitable doctrine of laches should not be 
applied to bar disqualification of the plaintiffs’ attorneys (cf: Dirkiis v Davis Aircraft Products Co., 
Itic., 123 AD2d 304, 506 NYS2d 203 [2d Dept. 19861; Thoitias Siipply & 
Eqiiipitreiit Co. Ltd. v 
White Fathers 
 OfAfrica, Im., 53 AD2d 607, 383 NYS2d 652 [2d Dept. 19761). Accordingly, 
Philip F. Alba, P.C. and trial counsel, Broder & Reiter, Esqs., are disqualified from representing 
any of the plaintiffs in Action No. 2. 
In view of the foregoing, the instant motion is granted.
