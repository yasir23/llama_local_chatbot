Petitioner Sdornon Smith Barney Inc. (“SSB”) brings this action for a @imirwy 
injunction against respondents Hunter and Stanczyk, firancial consultanls who resigncd from their 
employment with SSB, effective October 6,2000, to take employment with Prudential Securities 
Inc. Petitioner has comencd an arbitration proceeding bcfore the National Associalion of 
Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”). In this action, petitioner moves, pursuint to CPLR 75Q2(c), 
to restrain respondents, pending determination of the NASD arbitration, from “servicing or 
accepting any business or account transfers from SSB accounts acquired hy reason of hprcrpcr 
solicitation facilitated bough the use of SSB confidential and/or propriehry information or 
conduct.” Respondents cross-move to stay this action pending the NASD arbitration. 
A preliminary injunciion will be granted 4c~nly where the movant shows a likelihood of 
succc~s on the mcrirs, the potential for irrepwdde injury if he jnjunction is not grantcd and a 
balance of equitics in the movant’s fdvor (Grant Co. v. Srogi, - 52 NY2d 496, 5 17: McLaughlin,

In the instant case, petitioner contends that respondents violatcd written agreeincnts 8s 
well as common law and fiduciary obligations to SSB in &at they wrongfully copied and/or 
retained confidential and proprietary SSB documents, including customer lkts and CListonier 
account information, and “are undoubtedly soliciting SSB clients to transfer rhLit .* * accounts to 
Prudential.” (Aff. of Frank Albanese In Suppori, dated Oci. 10,2000,415, 12.) Respondents 
deny that they removed any original fdes from SSB. They acknowledge that they have clicnl 
information but cantend that this information pertains to their ow11 chts, and tkdt thy “have 
WEI~ right to maintain such information,” They further contend that they “have na information 
that originated with Smith Barney nor any hfomation reking 10 clients of other Smith Bariicy 
brokers,” (AfX of David Hunter, dated Oct. 16,2000, IS; Aff. Of Mark Stmcxyk, datcd Oct. 
16, 2000, 18.) 
Petitioner fails to make a prima facie showing of likelihood of success on the meri-ils. 
Contrary to petitiancr’s contention, neither respondcnt is suhject. to a restrhjvc covcnaiit. 
Petitioner argues that Stmczyk, though not Hunter, signed employment agrccmants coiitahhg 
restrictive covenants which bar Stanczyk’s solication of clients he serviced while at SSB. 
However, neither of the two agreements signed by Sianmyk (a Financial Consultmi Contmct and 
Franchise Protection Program agreement) is currently in eflwi,. 
Nor do rhe SSB Employee Handbooks show SSB’s cntitbmcnt Lo a prehiiinary 
injunction. Both respondcnts signed receipts for an Eniployec Handbook, dated Match 26, 1998, 
staling that thcy “agreeld] to be bound by be Traveler$/Salomon Smith Barney Principles of

Employment." Thc Principles of Ernploymcnt, in turn, specifically prccluded disclosure of 
confidential or proprietary information to anyone not afUated with SSB, provided thiit eniployee 
would not tie any confldentid records upon termination of ernploymcnl with SSD, and broadly 
defined confidential and proprietary information so as to include "clicnt documents" rind ''~lie~li 
lists." 
Howcver, the mwc fact that the SSB Handbooks dcfmed custoincr lists or information 
confidential will not servc to preclude use of the hts by former emphyces. Under well scttIed 
authority. customer lists will not be protected from use by a formcr employee abscnt evidencc lhai 
the lists were developed as the result of effort and expense on the employer's part and contain 
information which thc cmployee could not have obtained apart fiom the cmploymenr . k, 
McLam. Piven. V.oge1 v. Nolan & Co., 114 AD2d 165, supra; Town & CounQ Fso usc .& 
Home Sew. v. Newbery, 3 NY2d 554 [195X].) 
Even restrictive covenants are not enforceable IO protect an employer's "entire client base.' 
@DO Se-, 93 NY2d 382,391 [ 19991.) Wile a restrictive covenant may bc 
enforceable as to clients who were devcloped at the employer's expense, such a covcnaiil will nut 
be applied to "personal clients of [the employee] who came to the f3-m soldy IO avid themselves o 
his services and only as a result of his own independent recruitment eflorls, which [the crnploycl?r] 
neither subsidized nor otherwise financially supported as part of a program of client devclopment.' 
(Id, at 393.) Clearly, an Employee Hindbook can give an employer no greatcr protection from u 
former employec's use of client informatioii than would be tolerated undcr n restrictive covewm. 
Petitioner fails, howcver, to make a showing of likelihood of succcss on the nicrils ol its 
clainl that the clients serviced by respondents were developcd as a result ui SSB's effori and

expense. Petitioner’s claim that it devcloped the customer lists whosc use it secks to enjoin is 
bdsed on the wholly conclusory assertion that it spent milions of‘ dollars on advertising and 
mailings to potential clients. (Albanese AR, 9[ 41.) Petitionex does no1 deny respondcnts’claim 
that they brought with them Virtually all or most of their existing clients when they left other 
brokerage firms to join SSB. Morwver, petitioner does not deny rcspoiident Hunter’s ckim thal 
only 20 percent of his clients were opened at SSB, or respondent Stanczyk’s cld2im that a 
substantial portion of his clients were clients he had prior to his employment with SSB. (Hunter 
Aff., 9 10; Stancqk M., 12)’ 
Nor does petitioner show that the equities preponderate in its hvor. Petitioner does not 
dispure respondents’ avcrments that at the tjme they joined SSB, SSB reyuestd copies of thc 
account statement. for their chnts fioni their prior fxm, and that SSB sent “welcumc letters” to 
all of respondents’ existing clients along with account transfer forms. (Hunter Nf,, yI 8: Slanczyk 
AK, ¶ 12.) SSB’s failure to deny that it engagcd in such canduct raises serious questions as 10 
whether SSB is barred by the doctrine of unclean hands from seeking equitable rcbf from this 
Court, (Sec, Salomon Smith Brsrncv Inc. v Vockel, US Dkt Cr, ED Pa, May -, 2000, Bar& 
J., 2000 US Dist hxis 6167.) 
The COW further holds that SSB fa to show that it will suKm imparable injury Sa 
‘Questions as to whether SSB itself regards customer informtion as confidential are raised by iLs 
Iailure to cxplain the certifications of Robert Calabreso and Wjlliam Lmhey, apparetirly suhmilr~I in prior 
litigation, opposing enforcement by another hrokerqe firm or a restriajve mvenant in an ernploynicrlt 
agrcenlent signcd by a broker hired by SSB’s predecessor. In UE~ statenicnts, SSB’s prcdumsor look ulc 
position tixu account executives “almost always take virtually all of bir customers with them to thcjr ncw 
firm,” that they hwc a right to tab a copy ol account informaxion with them, and that this infcmialion is 
not in fact “a ‘customer list’ or propriiaary confidentid informtion of SnWi Barney” bul “bdoigs to tfir 
customas Lhemselvrx.” Calabrese AT., 8, 15.’’

preliminary injunction is not granted. Petitioner has an adequate remedy at law, as: any loss ol' 
client business may be adequately addrsssed by money dttmagcs. (See, Memill Lvnch. PiercA 
Farm Smith v. DeL~cre, 572 F Supp 246 [ND Ga 19831; Morrzan Stanlev Dean Witier v,, 
&&, US Dist Ct. ND Ga, 9943-2292, Sept. 10, 1999, Hunt, J.) 
IT IS ACCORDINGLY HEREBY ORDERED, that Lhe temporary restraining order, 
rendered on October 1 1,2000, is hereby vacatcd; and it is further 
ORDERED, that petitioner's motion for a preliminary injunction is denied wilhout 
prejudice to petitioner's right, if so advised, to seek injunctive relief 1~i'ore the NASD; and it is 
further 
ORDERED, that respondents' cross-motion is dcnicd as moot. 
This constitutes the decision and order of this Court.
