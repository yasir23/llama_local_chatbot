DECISION AND ORDER Plaintiff, 
-against - 
ARNOLD FALLEDER 
In this action for failure to pay a promissory note, plaintiff 
Cleora Borowski moves, pursuant to CPLR 3213, for summary judgment 
in lieu of complaint, against defendant Arnold Falleder in the sum 
of $36,879.83 with interest thereon from January 1, 2000, on the 
ground that this action is based on promissory notes for the 
payment of money only. - 
Defendant cross-moves, pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7) ‘dismiss the 
action on that the action is time-barred under CPLR 213 and section I\ 
3-122(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code and on the ground that the 
interest rates charged are usurious and violate sections 5-501 and 
5-511(2) of the General Obligations Law. 
FACTS 
On January 2, 1985, the litigants entered into a loan 
agreement whereby plaintiff agreed to loan the principal sum of 
$15,000 to defendant, president and sole owner of The Falleder 
Group, a non-party. Pursuant to the express terms of the loan, 
defendant agreed to repay $15,000 by January 3, 1986, together with 
interest thereon at the rate of 18% per annum on $10,000 and [* 2]
interest at the rate of 19%- per annum on $5,000. To secure payment 
of the loan, defendant pledged his entire interest in his 
cooperative apartment 7B which is located at 160 West 87th Street 
in Manhattan. 
On January 3, 1986, defendant reaffirmed his obligations under 
the loan agreement in two separate promissory notes executed by 
defendant. In the first promissory note, defendant agreeJto re-pay 
plaintiff the principal sum of $11,800.00, together with interest 
thereon at 18% per annum. In the second promissory note, 
defendants agreed to re-pay to plaintiff the principal sum of 
$5,950 .OO together with interest thereon at 19% per annum. Neither 
of these notes extend the re-payment date which was still listed as 
January 3, 1986. 
Plaintiff alleges that from March 1986 to June 1999, defendant 
made 38 payments in amounts ranging from $500 to $1,000 per 
payment. These payments were made by defendant against his 
personal checking account or on checks drawn on his business 
account. Some payments were even made in cash which defendant 
tendered to an intermediary, Wayne Caputo, who would issue a 
receipt to defendant and forward the payment on a check drawn 
against Mr. Caputo's own account. Defendant's last used his own 
personal check to pay an installment on May 5, 1992. This payment 
totaled $1,000. Plaintiff commenced this action in November 2000. 
DISCUSSION 
Statute of Limitations 
Section 3-122 of Uniform Commercial Code provides that a cause 
2 [* 3]
of action against the maker of a demand note accrues on the date of 
the note or, if no date is stated, on the date of issue 
(Skaneateles Sav. Bank v Modi Assocs. , 239 AD2d 40, 42 [4th Deptl, 
denied 92 NY2d 803 [1998] , citing UCC 3-122 [l] [b]) . However, 
article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code does not contain any 
Statute of Limitations governing suits on commercial paper 
(Skaneateles Sav. Bank v Modi Assocs. , suDra) . Therefore, the non- 
Code Statute of Limitations applicable to suits on written 
instruments applies (ibid.) . CPLR 213 (4) provides a six-year 
period in which to commence an action based upon a note. 
Although defendant correctly notes that the initial obligation 
became due and owing on January 3, 1986, this action is not time- 
barred. Under appropriate circumstances, a partial payment has the 
effect of renewing the Statue of Limitations (Skaneateles Sav. Bank 
v Modi Assocs., supra, 239 AD2d, at 42; citing Chemical Financial 
Servs. Corp. v Zaqaro, 173 Misc2d 745, 747 [Sup Ct, Kings County 
19971 citing Lew Morris Demolition Co., Inc. v Board of Education 
of the City of New York., 40 NY2d 516, 521 [1976] [remaining 
citations omitted]). Since defendant made continuous payments from 
March 1986 to June 1999, a promise may be inferred that defendant. 
would pay the balance of the note (Skaneateles Sav. Bank v Modi 
Assocs., supra; Chemical Financial Servs. Corp. v Zaqaro, supra, 
173 Misc2d, at 747; see, qenerally, Phoenix Acquisition Corp. 'c' 
Campcore, Inc., 81 NY2d 138, 143 [1993]). Since defendant does not 
deny that the June 1999 check, which was made to Mr. Caputo, was 
intended to cover his loans with plaintiff, this court finds that 
3 [* 4]
the part-payments of the- total debt tolled the Statue of 
Limitations so that it did not begin to run until the last 
acknowledged payment, which occurred in June 1999 (Skaneateles Sav. 
Bank v Modi Assocs., supra; Chemical Financial Servs. Corp. v 
Zaqaro, supra, 173 Misc2d, at 748). Since this action was commenced 
in November, 2000 --well within the six-year time period-- this 
matter was timely commenced and that branch of defendant's motion 
to dismiss is denied. 
Usury 
Pursuant to section 5-501 of the General Obligations Law a 
loan is deemed usurious if it exceeds an interest rate of 16% per 
annum (Tri-Land Props., Inc. v 115 West 28th Street Corp., 260 AD2d 
295, 296 [lst Dept 19991; Webar, Inc. v Capra, 212 AD2d 594, 595 
[2d Dept 19951; Brown v Blu, 1999 WL 1042904 [Sup Ct, NY County 
19991; Banking Law § 14-a). Moreover, section 5-511(2) of the 
General Obligations Law specifically provides that any note that 
recites a usurious rate of interest shall be void and the borrower 
is relieved of all further obligations to pay both principal and 
interest (Pemper v Reifer, 264 AD2d 625, 625 [lst Dept 19991 citing 
Seidel v 18 East 17th Street Owners, 79 NY2d 735, 740 [1992]). In 
such instances, the court shall enjoin prosecution and order the 
note to be surrendered and cancelled (Seidel v 18 East 17th Street 
Owners, supra, citing GOL § 5-511 [2] ; Brown v Blu, supra). 
However, public policy in New York is more lenient towards 
higher interest rates in commercial loans on the grounds that 
businesses should be able to secure financing at the market rate 
4 [* 5]
(Schneider v Phelps, 41 NY2d-238, 243 [1977]). In fact, section 5- 
521(1) of the General Obligations Law specifically provides that a 
corporation is prohibited from asserting the defense of usury 
(Seidel v 18 East 17th Street Owners, supra, 79 NY2d at 740-741; 
Webar, Inc. v Capra, supra, 212 AD2d, at 595, citing Schneider v 
Phelps, supra). New York also holds that the individual guarantors 
of a corporate obligation are precluded from asserting the defense 
of usury (Schneider v Phelps, supra at 242; Webar, Inc. v Capra, 
supra, citing General Phoenix Corp. v Cabot, 300 NY 87, 95 [19491). 
In this situation, defendant borrower signed a note which 
clearly stated that he was the president and sole owner of a 
corporate entity. Defendant does not explain why it was necessary 
to identify his corporate relationship if the loan was purely 
personal in nature. In particular, defendant does not even state in 
his opposition that the loan was granted to him solely in his 
capacity as a private individual for a personal purpose or that he 
qualifies for the exception in section 5-521(2) of the General 
Obligations Law which permits corporations, in which the sole asset 
is a one-or two-family home, to raise the defense of usury under 
certain circumstances (North Broadway Fundinq Corp. v Freed, 45 
AD2d 759 [2d Dept 19741). Therefore, defendant does not raise an 
issue of fact concerning the nature of the underlyi-ng loan and this 
court finds no grounds to order a hearing on this issue. Si.nce 
defendant has failed to support his usury defense, his cross motion 
is denied. In turn, plaintiff's moti.on for summary judgment in 
lieu of complaint is granted. 
5 [* 6]
Accordingly, it is ~ 
ORDERED that defendant's cross motion to dismiss is denied; 
and it is further 
ORDERED that plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in lieu 
of complaint is granted and the Clerk of the Court is directed to 
enter judgment in favor of plaintiff and agsint defendant in the 
amount of $36,879.83, together with interest as allowed by law from 
January 1, 2000 until the date of entry of judgment, as calculated 
by the Clerk, and thereafter at the statutory rate, together with 
costs and disbursements to be taxed by the Clerk upon submission of 
an appropriate bill of costs.
