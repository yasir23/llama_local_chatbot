Upon the foregoing papers, fhe decision and order of the court is as follows: 
This is an action to set aside fraudulent conveyances by M.T.P. 59 St., LLC 
(“MTP 59”) and to hold the other named defendants liable for a money judgment 
previously obtained against MTP 59. Plaintiff (“DASNY) brought a prior motion seeking 
an order of attachment against defendants David Avital (“Avital”) and Pernilla Andren- 
Avital (“Andren”). Avital and Andren are members of MTP 59, limited liability company. 
Pursuant to this court’s order dated March 29, 201 I I the court granted DASNY a 
temporary restraining order, restraining Avital and Andren from transferring or paying 
Page 1 of 5 [* 2]
any of their assets (Order, March 29, 201 1, Gische J.) (“TROII). Thereafter, the court 
granted DASNY’s motion for an order of attachment. In the court’s prior order dated 
May 17, 2001 (“prior order”), Avital and Andren were “restrained and prohibited from 
transferring, encumbering, or paying any assets of defendants, or any personal property 
in which said defendants have an interest, or any debt owed to said defendants to the 
extent of $387,143.36,” pending further order or Judgment of the court. The court’s 
decision was rendered on default as there was due proof of service. 
Avital and Andren now move to vacate the court’s prior order based upon CPLR 
@SO15 and 6223 [a]. To prevail on a motion to vacate an order entered on default, the 
party seeking that relief must set forth excusable default and a meritorious defense 
(CPLR 5 5015 [a]; Gray v. B.R. Truck ins Co., 59 N.Y.2d 649 [1983]). Avital and 
Andren contend they satisfy both requirements. 
Their excuse, as set forth in the sworn affidavit of Avital, is that the plaintiff 
served its prior motion (an order to show cause) along with several copies of the 
summons and complaint for the other named defendants. Believing the extra papers 
were just copies pleadings, Avital states he threw out all but one copy of the summons 
and complaint. According to Avital, upon being served, he contacted his attorney who 
obtained additional time to respond to the complaint. 
Avital and Andren’s lawyer (“Attorney Shanks”) states that he contacted the 
attorney for DASNY and obtained an extension of time to answer the complaint. 
According to Attorney Shanks, his clients did not know about the order to show cause 
because they threw it out and DASNY’s attorney did not mention the motion to him so 
he never learned about it until after receiving this court’s order. The court does not find 
Page 2 of 5 [* 3]
this excuse acceptable. While the attorneys did not know about the order the show 
cause, because their clients never presented it to them, it is incomprehensible that the 
clients, who are business people, would throw legal papers out without looking at them 
and simply assume they were all the same. The court also rejects any arguments by 
Avital and Andren that DASNY engaged in sanctionable activity or unethical conduct. 
DASNY’s attorney was under no obligation to keep Attorney Shanks apprised about the 
status of the case. Such information is available to the public through SCROLL, the 
court’s online library. Even if the defendants had provided an excusable default, for the 
reasons set forth below, they have not established a meritorious defense tot he granting 
of an order of attachment. 
Avital, the manager of MTP 59, the entity against which there is a money 
judgment, states in his sworn affidavit that he and Andren have not, as DASNY claims, 
been transferring MTP 59’s assets to defraud the plaintiff. He explains that certain cash 
distributions to him are merely accounting entries and adjustments to accounts for 
either earlier transactions remaining on MTP 59’s books or non-income transactions. 
Thus, Avital claims the entries do not represent tangible monies at all, but “paper” 
transactions. 
Avital also explains that certain transactions “net out” one another, such as the 
withdrawal of money from a line of credit and the record of a loan payable to Chase 
Manhattan is an equivalent amount. 
Avital explains further that a certain savings account in the name of MTP 59 did 
not, in fact, actually contain money belonging to that entity but were the property of 
Page 3 of 5 [* 4]
another entity by the name of “MTP Eastside, LLC” and that whomever opened the 
account in the name of MTP 59 “made an error.” 
On a motion for an order of attachment, the plaintiff must show, by affidavit and 
other evidence that: I) there is a cause of action, 2) it is probable that the plaintiff will 
succeed on the merits, 3) one or more grounds for attachment provided in section 6201 
exist, and 4) the amount demanded from the defendant exceeds all counterclaims 
known to the plaintiff. Pursuant to CPLR 5 6201 an order of attachment may be 
granted when: “I) the defendant is a non-domiciliary residing without the state, OR is a 
foreign corporation not qualified to do business in the state; OR ... 3) the defendant, 
with the intent to defraud its creditors or frustrate the enforcement of a judgment that 
might be rendered in plaintiffs favor, has assigned, disposed or, or encumbered or 
secreted property, or removed it from the state or is about to do any of these acts; ...” 
On the underlying motion, DASNY met its burden of proof by identifying various 
transactions which could be seen as evasive measures by Avital and Andren. While on 
this motion to vacate their default Avital has tried to explain the transactions and show 
they were nothing more than accounting entries, not physical manifestations of “real 
money” transfers, the explanation does not justify vacature of the attachment order that 
was previously granted. 
The complaint asserts two different theories of recovery, one being that Avital 
dominates MTP 59 and, therefore, the corporate veil should be pierced (4th cause of 
action) and the other that payments and transfers are being made in violation of the 
debtor and creditor law (Ist, 2”, and 3rd causes of action). The activities that plaintiff 
Page4of 5 [* 5]
has identified and confirmed by Avital, justify the order of attachment remaining in place 
at this time to protect the plaintiffs interests. 
Other arguments by Avital, that there is little likelihood they can secret away 
assets because their business, income and bank accounts are all in New York, are 
unhelpful. Plaintiff does not have to take their word that they will not transfer assets to 
defeat plaintiffs right to satisfy the judgment. 
Therefore, the motion by the defendants to vacate the order of attachment 
entered against them on default is denied as they have failed to show they have a 
meritorious defense. The prior order remains unmodified and fully enforceable. 
Any relief otherwise requested but not expressly addressed is hereby denied 
This constitutes the decision and order of the court.
