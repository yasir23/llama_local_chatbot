PUBLIC SERVICE MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, 
Defendant. 
MARILYN SHAFER, J.: 
The plaintiff West 1 6‘h Street Tenants Corp. (“Tenants Corp.”) moves, pursuant to CPLR 
3215, for the entry of a default judgment against the defendant Public Service Mutual Insurance 
Company (“Public Service”). 
Public Service cross-moves, pursuant to CPLR 3012(d), for an order compelling the 
plaintiff Tenants Corp. to accept the answer. 
The plaintiff Tenants Corp. is a cooperative corporation located at 32 1 West 1 6‘h Street, in 
Manhattan. The defendant Public Service is an insurance company which sold both a commercial, 
and an umbrella, insurance policy to Tenants Corp. 
On October 1 1, 1999, a worker sustained personal injury when he fell from a scaffold 
while repointing chimney bricks on the roof of 321 West 16th Street. On December 27, 1999, the 
worker filed an action against Tenants Corp. On March 17, 2000, Tenants Corp. alleges that it 
received notice of the lawsuit and notified its insurer, Public Service. On April 27, 2000, Public 
Service disclaimed coverage for lack of timely notice. 
1 [* 2 ]
This action, for a judgment declaring that Public Service must defend and indemnify 
Tenants Corp. in the underlying personal injury action, was commenced on July 7,2000. 
In support of its motion for a default judgment, the plaintiff Tenants Corp. argues that no 
answer has been filed, and that there is no meritorious defense to its action for a declaratory 
judgment, as Tenants Corp. had a good-faith reasonable belief that no personal injury claim would 
be made against it. 
In opposition to the motion for a default judgment, and in support of its cross motion to 
compel acceptance of the answer, the defendant Public Service argues that it mistakenly served its 
answer on the attorney in the underlying personal injury action. Allegedly, it was not until this 
motion was made that the mistake was discovered. Public Service also argues that late notice of 
occurrence from its insured is a meritorious defense. 
In opposition to the cross motion, and in further support of its motion, the plaintiff 
Tenants Corp. argues that: the proposed answer is not verified; it is ironic that an insurer 
disclaiming coverage for late notice asks that the court overlook late service of the answer; and 
the building is a small cooperative with just 10 tenant shareholders, who have been forced to 
retain counsel and are exposed to a large recovery in the underlying personal injury suit. 
The law favors the resolution of cases on the merits. A defendant seeking to be excused 
from the failure to timely file and serve an answer must demonstrate a meritorious defense and a 
reasonable excuse for the default (CPLR 2005; Santora & McKav v Mazzella, 2 1 1 AD2d 460 [ 1 st 
Dept 19951). Although the defendant Public Service demonstrates a reasonable excuse for the 
default, it fails to allege facts sufficient to establish the existence of a meritorious defense. 
The requirement that an insured notify its liability carrier of a potential claim as soon as 
2 [* 3 ]
practicable operates as a condition precedent to coverage (White by White v City of New York, 
81 NY2d 955, 957 [1993]). A reasonable belief in non-liability may excuse an insured’s failure to 
give timely notice, but the insured has the burden of showing the reasonableness of such excuse 
(Security Mut. Ins. Co. of New York v Acker-Fitzsimons CorD., 31 NY2d 436,441 [1972]). 
Generally, questions of the insured’s good faith and reasonableness in believing that it would not 
be sued, and in delaying notification to the insurer, are issues to be resolved by the trier of fact 
(Mighty Midgets, Inc. v Centennial Ins. Co., 47 NY2d 12,21 [1979]). 
However, an insurer must give written notice of disclaimer on the ground of late notice as 
soon as is reasonably possible after it first learns of the accident or of grounds for disclaimer of 
liability, and failure to so do precludes effective disclaimer (Insurance Law 4 3420[d]; Hartford 
Ins. Co. v Countv of Nassau, 46 NY2d 1028, 1029 [1979]). This is true because the sole ground 
for disclaiming liability is readily apparent to the carrier when it receives notice of the accident; 
and where the carrier itself has unreasonably delayed in making a disclaimer, it cannot take 
advantage of a failure to give timely notice of the accident (Kramer v Interboro Mut. Indem. Ins. 
- Co., 176 AD2d 308 [2d Dept 19911). 
Whether a particular lapse of time is reasonable is generally a question of fact for a jury 
(Allstate Ins. Co. v Gross , 27 NY2d 263 [1970]). However, an unexplained delay of two months 
in disclaiming liability for late notice has been held unreasonable as a matter of law (Hartford Ins. 
Co. v Countv of Nassau, supra). Similarly, an unexplained delay of 41 days was held to be 
unreasonable as a matter of law (Matter of Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v Steiner. 199 AD2d 507 
[2d Dept 19931). On the other hand, short explained delays of approximately three weeks have 
been held to be reasonable as a matter of law (State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v Daniels. 269 
3 [* 4 ]
AD2d 860 [4‘h Dept 20001; Can-Am Roofing v American States Ins. Co., 229 AD2d 973 [4th 
Dept 19961). Delays of 30 days have been held to be neither reasonable, nor unreasonable as a 
matter of law, requiring a trial (Hess v Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 273 AD2d 689 [3rd Dept 20001; 
Murphy v Hanover Ins. Co., 239 AD2d 323 [2d Dept 19971). 
In the instant case, the delay of 41 days in disclaiming was unreasonable as a matter of 
law. The defendant Public Service attempts to explain away the 41 days by alleging that it was 
investigating the claim. However, as mentioned above, delay by an insured in notifying an insurer 
of the claim, as a ground for disclaiming coverage is, as a matter of law, readily apparent to the 
carrier when it receives notice of the accident. Therefore, there was absolutely no need for a 41 
day “investigation” by Public Service before it disclaimed. Public Service’s claims regarding its 
“investigation” are tailored to avoid the law’s requirement that it timely notify its insured of the 
disclaimer. 
Furthermore, the delay, from March 17,2000 to April 27, 2000, is exactly the same as the 
41-day delay in Matter of Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v Steiner (supra), found to be unreasonable 
as a matter of law. 
Accordingly, it is 
ORDERED that the plaintiffs motion for a default judgment is granted and the Clerk is 
directed to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, together with costs 
and disbursements to be taxed by the Clerk upon submission of an appropriate bill of costs; and it 
is further 
ORDERED that the defendant’s cross motion to compel acceptance of the answer is 
denied; and it is further
