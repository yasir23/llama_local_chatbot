Upon the foregoing papers, defendants Joseph and Dorothy DeNicola and the Estate 
of John DeNicola move for an order: (1) pursuant to CPLR 3404 dismissing the plaintiffs 
action as aLi~lridoned; (2) eiijoining plaintiffs from comniencing any furthcr procccdings to [* 1]
restore the case to calendar; and (3) imposing sanctions upon plaintiffs’ attorneys for 
commencing a frivolous action. Plaintiff Anthony DeNicola (hereinafter “plaintiff ’) cross- 
moves for an order restoring this action to the calendar and substituting the Estate of John 
DeNicola as party plaintiff in place of John DeNicola. 
In this action for, inter alia, the sale and partition of certain real property, a note of 
issue was filed on or about October 19, 1998. Thereafter, on June 17, 1999, that note of 
issue was vacated and the case was marked off the trial calendar when defendant failed to 
appear for a calendar call. On or about August 26, 1999, defendants moved to restore the 
case to the calendar. That motion was returnable on September 30, 1999, but the parties 
stipulated to adjourn it to October 28, 1999. The motion was marked off the calendar on 
September 30th when defendant failed to submit that stipulation at a calendar call. 
On or about March 20,2001, defendants made this motion pursuant to CPLR 3404 
to dismiss the action as abandoned. Thereafter, on or about June 6, 2001, plaintiff cross- 
moved to restore the case to the trial calendar and to substitute the Estate of Michael 
DcNico1;i as plaintiff in place of Michael DeNicola, who died on May 12,2000. 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the case as abandoned is denied and plaintiffs’ cross- 
motion to restore their action to the calendar is granted. CPLR 3404 provides that an action 
is deemed abandoned and automatically dismissed if plaintiff fails to move to restore it to 
the calendar within a year of the date it was stricken. Here, the case was struck from the 
calendar on October 1, 1999, and the motion to restore was not brought until June 6,2001. 
2 [* 2]
However, the proceedings were automatically stayed from May 12, 2000, the date of 
Michael DeNicola’s death, until the date upon which a duly appointed representative is 
substituted by the court ( CPLR 1015, 1021; see, Novaro v Jomar Real Estate COT., - 
AD2d -, 725 NYS2d 543; Hmdinc v Noble Taxi Corp.. 155 AD2d 265). On March 13, 
2001, DeNicola’s widow Carmela DeNicola was appointed as personal representative of the 
estate and on March 6,200 1, plaintiff sought an order pursuant to CPLR 102 1 to substitute 
the estate for the deceased plaintiff.’ Thus, since this action has been stayed since the date 
of Michael DeNicola’a death, which occurred within the year following the default, plaintiff 
did not abandon his case and CPLR 3404 is not applicable to this action. 
To obtain relief from an order on judgment marking the case off the calendar based 
on an excusable default for failure to appear for a calendar call, a party must provide a 
reasonable excuse for the failure to appear and demonstrate the merits of the cause of action 
or defense (e CPLR 501 5 (a)( 1); Latha Kesmmnr Cop i., ’lower Ins. Co., - AD2d 
-9 * 2001 WL 844763 Mediavilla v Gurman, 272 AD2d 146, 148). 
JTcrc. plaintiffs affidavit ofmerit sufficiently sets forth a meritorious cause of action. 
In that affidavit, plaintiff alleges that he had lived with his mother in a house owned by her 
and that his mother had refused to sign a deed transferring ownership in the house to 
defendants (his two brothers). However, claims plaintiff, after his mother died, defendant 
Since plaintiffs cross-motion for substitution was made within a reasonable time of 
Michael DeNicola’s death and the appointment of a personal representative, the court grants that 
part of the motion which seeks to substitute the Estate of Michael DeNicola for Michael 
DiNicola (see, Rosenfeld v Hotel Com., 25 NY2d 25,29; Orellana v Malek, 116 AD2d 557). 
3 [* 3]
Joseph DeNicola and his wife, defendant Dorothy DeNicola produced a deed purpor-ling to 
transfer ownership in the house to Joseph and his deceased brother, John, and shortly 
thereafter, plaintiff was served with eviction papers. According to plaintiff, he compared 
the signature on the deed to his mother’s known signature and concluded it was a forgery. 
Those allegations sufficiently make out a cause of action pursuant to Articles 9 and 15 of 
the Real Property Law to compel the determination of both plaintiff and the estate of 
Michael DeNicola’s claim to the disputed real property and for a partition sale of that 
property.2 
Plaintiff also presents a reasonable excuse for his default. Plaintiffs attorney 
explains in an affidavit that an attorney who was no longer with the firm had been handling 
the case and it is unclear why he did not appear for the calendar call on the date that the case 
was marked off the calendar. However, the attorney explains that a motion to restore the 
case to the calendar was returnable on September 30, 1999; a stipulation was entered into 
by the attorneys for the plaintiffs and defendants to adjourn the motion to October 28,1999. 
Plaintiffs attorney had employed the American Clerical Service to submit the stipulation at 
the September 30th calendar call, but in an affidavit, the managing clerk for that service 
explains that it was mistakenly not submitted. As a result, the motion was marked off the 
calendar on September 30th. This explanation of inadvertent law office failure as well as

On Nov 14, 1996, this court (Golden, J.), 
summary judgment, indicating that material 
claim that the cause of action is a “sham”. in a short-form order, denied defendants’ motion for 
facts are disputed, contradicting defendants’ present 
4 [* 4]
the failure of the clerical services provides a sufficient excuse for plaintiffs failure to appcar 
for the calendar call (see, CPLR 2005; Sanchez v Javind Apt. Com., 246 AD2d 353).3 
The court has considered defendant’s other contentions and finds them to be without 
merit. 
Accordingly, defendant’s motion: (1) pursuant to CPLR 3404 dismissing the 
plaintiffs action as abandoned; (2) enjoining plaintiffs from commencing any further 
proceedings to restore the case to calendar; and, (3) imposing sanctions upon plaintiffs’ 
attorneys for commencing a frivolous action is denied in its entirety. Defendant’s cross- 
motion to restore this case to the trial calendar and to substitute the estate of Michael 
DeNicola as plaintiff in place of the deceased Michael DeNicola is granted. The caption is 
hereby amended to read as follows:

Defendants. Index No. 24296/94 
In light of this evidence that plaintiff did not intend to abandon this action as well as 
the fact that plaintiffs attorney made this motion just three months after a personal representative 
was appointed and the lack of any evidence of prejudice to defendants, the court notes that, even 
had more than a year elapsed before the motion to restore was made, dismissal would not be 
warranted under CPLR 3404.
