Defendant, LAWRENCE LOSCALZO, seeks summary judgment pursuant to CPLR 
§3212. Defendant, VICTOR PAFUNDI, cross-moves for summary judgment. 
Plaintiffs commenced this action for personal injuries sustained in a 
fire occurring on 518 Main Road, Aquebogue, NY. The two (2) infant 
plaintiffs, ANNA MARIE SIMMONS and JEFFREY SIMMONS, JR., sustained serious 
injuries, the most serious being suffered by ANNA MARIE SIMMONS who 
sustained second degree burns over almost seventy (70%) percent of her body 
resulting in degloving of the face, scalp, hands, trunk, chest, back, hips 
and destruction of her ears, nose and loss of her fingers and hair. The 
plaintiffs allege that defendant, LAWRENCE LOSCALZO, failed to provide 
smoke detectors on the premises, failed to provide for the safety of the 
plaintiffs and warn the plaintiffs of the hazardous condition. There are [* 1 ]
also alleged code violations of the Riverhead Town Code and Title 9 of 
NYCRR . 
The premises in question are owned by defendant, AAA BUFFALO ONE 
GEVELOPMENT CORP. The alleged owner of the premises, AAA BUFFALO ONE 
DEVELOPMENT CORP., did not have any insurance on the premises. LAWRENCE 
LOSCALZO is President of said corporation. Defendant, VICTOR PAFUNDI, 
rented the premises to the SIMMONS family. Plaintiffs paid their share of 
rent for the premises to Mr. PAFUNDI. The balance of the rent was paid by 
the Department of Social Services. Counsel for LAWRENCE LOSCALZO states 
that summary judgment should be granted to his client because a corporate 
officer cannot be held personally responsible for any alleged corporate 
wrongdoing. Counsel further argues that plaintiffs have failed to meet 
their burden for piercing the corporate veil. (see, Maggio v Becca Const. 
Co., Inc., 229 AD2d 426, 644 NYS2d 802, (2nd Dept., 1996)) 
Counsel for defendant, VICTOR PAFUNDI, argues for summary judgment in 
that this defendant was acting as agent for AAA BUFFALO ONE DEVELOPMENT 
CORP. and an agent cannot be held liable for a disclosed principal on 
breach of contract or negligence. The Court notes that the Housing 
Verification form lists Mr. PAFUNDI as authorized agent. 
Summary judgment is a drastic remedy which should not be granted if 
there is any doubt as to the existence of a triable issue. (Barclay v 
Denckla, 182 AD2d 658, 582 NYS2d 252 (2nd Dept., 1992)) It is a well- 
settled that the movant has the burden of proof to demonstrate the absence 
of any material issues of fact. (Tessier v New York City Health and 
Hospitals Corporation, 177 AD2D 626, 576 NYS2D 331 (2" Dept., 1991)). 
Thereafter, the opposing party must produce evidentiary proof, in 
admissible form, which demonstrates that a trial is required because of 
material questions of fact. (Taylor-Warner Corp. v Minskoff, 167 AD2d 382, 
561 NYS2d 797 (2nd Dept., 1990)) . 
Defendant, VICTOR PAFUNDI, has failed to show entitlement to summary 
judgment. It is true that an agent for a disclosed principal, acting 
within his representative capacity and under the direction of the principal 
cannot be held liable. (see, Lennon v Oakhurst Gardens Corp., 229 AD2d 897, 
645 NYS2d 652, 
Verification form, Mr. PAFUNDI wrote that he was the agent for Mr. 
LOSCALZO. He did not disclose that he was the agent for the corporate owner 
of the premises. Both defendants, LOSCALZO and PAFUNDI, now allege that 
AAA BUFFALO ONE DEVELOPMENT CORP., was the owner of the leased premises. (3rd Dept., 1996)) Nevertheless, according to the Housing 
It is clear to this Court that, at best, defendant/PAFUNDI was 
acting as an agent for a partially disclosed principal and as such, he 
cannot be absolved of liability. (see, Tarolli Lumber Co., Inc v Andreassi, 
59 AD2d 1011, 399 NYS2d 739 (4th Dept., 1977) ; New England Marine 
Contractors, Inc. v Martin, 156 AD2d 804, 549 NYS2d 535 (3rd Dept., (1989) ; 
Continental Manor I1 Condominium Homeowners Association v Depew, 2000 NY 
Slip Op. 10193, 717 NYS2d 206 (2nd Dept.) Accordingly, the motion for 
summary judgment of defendant, PAFUNDI, is denied in its entirety. 
Defendant LOSCALZO, has shown entitlement to summary judgment because 
he is a corporate officer only, and not the owner of the premises. [* 2 ]
Plaintiffs, however, demonstrate factual issues precluding summary 
judgment. The alleged owner of the premises, AAA BUFFALO ONE DEVELOPMENT 
CORP., did not have any insurance on the premises. The Department of Social 
Services supplemented the payment of rent and paid $300 for monthly rent 
directly to LAWRENCE LOSCALZO. No payments were made to the corporate 
defendant. 
LAWRENCE LOSCALZO as the landlord and list his social security number. 
rent payments by the plaintiff were given to defendant, PAFUNDI, in cash, 
which was delivered to LAWRENCE LOSCALZO. The corporate defendant reported 
on its income tax returns for 1996 $1,800.00 in rental income. The rental 
payments consisted of $600.00 per month in total and as such, the corporate 
defendant only reported half of the income received. The Housing Verification form and the Vendor Data mentioned

owner exercised complete domination in respect to the rental property and 
that such domination was used to commit fraud or wrong against the 
plaintiffs resulting in plaintiffs’ injuries. (see, Morris v NYS
