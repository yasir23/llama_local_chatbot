after hearing counsel in support of and opposed to the motion) it is, 
ORDERED that this motion by the defendant, Lynn M. Hackal, for 
summary judgment and dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint pursuant to CPLR 
S3212 and Insurance Law S5102 and 5104 on the ground that the plaintiff, 
James K. Weir, has not sustained a "serious physical injury" as such 
term is defined in Insurance Law 
ยง5102(d) is hereby denied in its 
entirety. 
This action was instituted by the plaintiffs for personal 
injuries allegedly sustained by James K. Weir in a motor vehicle 
accident occurring on March 18, 1999 at approximately 8:OO am on Main 
Street in front of the Riverhead Auto Parts Store in Riverhead, Suffolk 
County on Long Island, New York. Plaintiff was stopped and parked to 
make a delivery on Main Street and had entered the back of his truck to 
pick up a battery for delivery when the defendant, Lynn M. Hackal, 
crashed into the rear of the plaintiff's truck. Ms. Hackel was arrested 
by the town police for driving while intoxicated and a blood alcohol 
test showed her level to be a .24, more than twice the legal limit. The 
defendant was subsequently convicted of driving while intoxicated in 
violation of Vehicle & Traffic Law ยง1192 (2). This lawsuit, thereafter, 
ensued. 
Defendant, Lynn M. Hackel, now moves for summary judgment 
pursuant to CPLR S3212 dismissing plaintiff James K. Weir's complaint on [* 1]
Weir v. Hackal 
Page 2 
the grounds that the plaintiff James K. Weir has not sustained a 
"serious physical injury " as that term is defined in Insurance Law 
. 
ยง5102(d). Plaintiff James K. Weir opposes the motion. For the reasons 
set forth herein, defendant Lynn M. Hackel's, motion for summary 
judgment and dismissal of plaintiff James K. Weir's complaint is denied 
in its entirety. 
The function of the court on a motion for summary judgment is 
issue finding not issue determination. It is a most drastic remedy 
which should not be granted where there is any doubt as to the existence 
of a triable issue or where the issue is even arguable. Elzer v. Nassau 
County, 111 AD2d 212, 489 NYS2d 246 (2nd Dept. 1985); Steven v. Parker, 
99 AD2d 649, 472 NYS2d 225 (2nd Dept. 1984); Gaeta v. New York News, 
Inc., 95 AD2d 325, 466 NYS2d 321 (1st Dept. 1983). As the New York 
Court of Appeals noted in Sillman v. Twentieth Centurv Fox, 3 NY2d 395, 
404 (1957): 
"TO grant summary judgment it must 
clearly appear that no material and 
triable issue of fact is presented 
(Duenna & Sons v. Citv of New York, 301 
NY 118.). This drastic remedy should not 
be granted where there is any doubt as to 
the existence of such issues (Braun v. 
Carey, 280 App. Div. 1019), or where the 
issue is 'arguable' 
 (Barnett v. Jacobs, 
255 NY 520, 522); 'issue finding, rather 
than issue determination is the key to the 
procedure' (Esteve v. Avad, 271 App. Div. 
725, 727) 
 .I1 
Although the question of the existence of a "serious injury " 
is often left to the jury, where properly raised, the issue of whether a 
plaintiff is barred from recovery in a judicial forum for want of a 
"serious injury " is, in the first instance, for the Court's determin - 
ation. Zoldas v. Louis Cab Corn., 108 AD2d 378, 489 NYS2d 468 (1st 
Dept. 1985); Dwv er v. Tracy, 105 AD2d 476, 480 NYS2d 781 (3rd Dept. 
1984). If it can be said, as a matter of law, that plaintiff suffered 
no serious injury within the meaning of the Insurance Law, then plain - 
tiff has no claim to assert and there is nothing for the jury to decide. 
Licari v. Elliott, 57 NY2d 230, 455 NYS2d 570 (1982). 
Section 5104 of the Insurance Law provides that an individual 
injured in an automobile accident may bring a negligence cause of action 
only upon a showing that the individual has incurred a "serious injury" [* 2]
Weir v. Hackal 
Page 3 
within the meaning of the no-fault law. Insurance Law 
 ยง5102(d) defines 
"serious injury " as a personal injury which results in death; permanent 
loss of use of a body organ, member, function or system; permanent con - 
sequential limitation of use of a body organ or member, significant 
limitation of use of a body function or system; or a medically deter- 
mined injury or impairment of a non-permanent nature which prevents the 
injured person from performing substantially all of the material acts 
which constitute such person's usual and customary daily activities for 
not less than ninety days during the one hundred eighty days immediately 
following the occurrence of the injury or impairment. 
While defendant's medical authority, Seth B. Paul, M.D., 
claims no significant limitation or use of a body member, plaintiffs' 
submitted medical authority, in a sworn affidavit by Jeffrey M. Block, a 
chiropractor, notes that plaintiff James K. Weir has a significant 
limitation of movement and use of the cervical regions of the spine and 
provides documented ranges of motion which are restricted or limited by 
pain. These limitation of movements were calculated at 10% or more. 
Dr. Block also noted that the plaintiff had sustained a herniated disc 
at t'he C6-C7 on the right side of the cervical cord as demonstrated in 
an MRI taken by Dr. Albert Zilkha of Long Island Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging on March 29, 1999 and provided to the plaintiff's treating 
physician, John S. Walsh, M.D.. Dr. Block has posited that the injuries 
are both consequential to the accident and permanent in nature. Thus, 
the plaintiff has presented both an affirmation setting forth the 
doctor's observations supported by objective proof, through specific 
testing of range motion limitations and an MRI documenting a herniated 
disc sufficient to raise an issue of fact warranting denial of the 
motion for summary judgment. See, Grossman v. 
Wricrht,268 AD2d 79, 707 
NYS2d 233 
(2nd Dept. 2000); Kraemer v. 
Henninq, 237 AD2d 492, 655 NYS2d 
96 
(2nd Dept. 1997). 
Generally a soft tissue injury with cervical and low back 
sprain does not meet the threshold for serious injury 
 (DeFelippo v. 
White, 101 AD2d 801, 475 NYS2d 141). These were the types of injuries 
which the legislature hoped would no longer burden the court system 
under the no-fault scheme (Scheer v. Koubek, 70 NYS2d 678, 518 NYS2d 
788). Neither are subjective complaints of transitory pain due to 
cervical and lumbar sprains sufficient 
 (Georcria v. 
Ramautar, 180 AD2d 
713, 579 NYS2d 743). However, the Second Department, Appellate Division 
has consistently held that where there is objective proof of the 
cervical and lumbosacral pain by way of an MRI or x-ray showing a 
physical injury (Jackson v. United Parcel 
Service, 204 AD2d 605, 612 
NYS2d 186; 
Flanacran v Hoeg, 212 AD2d 756, 624 NYS2d 853; or by a 
chiropractor's report or affidavit setting forth the degree of any 
limitation of movement (Rut v. 
Gricronis, 214 AD2d 721, 625 NYS2d 633; [* 3]
, 
Weir v. Hackal 
Page 4 
Carucci v. 
 TZ~OPOU~OS, 1997 WL 214768; Steuer v. 
Didonna, 650 NYS2d 
298; Kraemer v. 
 Heninq, 655 NYS2d 96), then the plaintiff has either met 
his prima facie burden or raised a triable issue of fact warranting a 
denial of a summary judgment motion on the issue of threshold. 
Although a minor limitation of movement is not consistent with 
the threshold (Gaddv v. Evler, 79 NY2d 955, 582 NYS2d 990), the Second 
Department has held that a 10% restriction or more in the movement of 
the lumbar spine is sufficient to establish a significant permanent 
limitation of a bodily function. (Schwartz v. New York Citv 
 Housinq, 646 
NYS2d 30). See, Lazarre v. 
Kopczvnski, 160 AD2d 772, 553 NYS2d 488 
(2nd 
Dept. 1990) ; Parker v. Smith, 242 AD2d 374, 664 NYS2d 374 
 (Znd Dept. 
1997). 
"The limitation or use of a body member or organ must be 
permanent and consequential but the limitation need not be total." 
Savacre v. Delacruz, 200 AD2d 707, 474 NYS2d 850 (1984). A 'serious 
injury' definition should be construed to mean that a person has been 
curtailed from performing his usual activities to a great extent rather 
than' some slight curtailment. Sole v. Kurnik, 119 AD2d 974, 500 NYS2d 
872 (4th Dept. 1986) 
While permanent loss does not necessitate proof of a total 
loss of the "organ, member, function or 
system" it must establish 
operating in some limited way or only with pain. Dwv er v. Tracev, 105 
AD2d 4767, 480 NYS2d 781 (3rd Dept. 1984). "It is well settled that 
pain can form the basis of a serious 
 injury." Ottavio v. Moore, 141 
AD2d 806, 529 NYS2d 876 (2nd Dept. 1978), appeal denied 73 NY2d 704, 537 
NYS2d 492 (1989). See also, Butchino v. Bush, 109 AD2d 1001, 486 NYS2d 
478 (3rd Dept. 1985). 
It is the function of the court on a motion for summary 
judgment to consider all the facts in a light most favorable to the 
party opposing the motion, 
 !l%omas v. Drake, 145 AD2d 687, 535 NYS2d 229 
(3rd Dept. 1988) and to determine whether there are any material and 
triable issues of fact presented. The key is issue finding, not issue 
determination, and the court should not attempt to determine questions 
of credibility. S.J. Capelin Assoc. v. Globe, 34 NY2d 338, 357 NYS2d 
478 (1974). Questions of credibility between experts on behalf of 
plaintiff and defendant are for the jury and not the court to determine 
Under the facts and circumstances of the instant case, 
considered in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the Court finds 
that the plaintiff, James K. Weir, has provided sufficient medical 
evidence to raise a factual issue which requires resolution by a jury. 
It is well settled that pain can form the basis of a serious injury. [* 4]

Moonev v. Ovitt, 100 AD2d 702, 474 NYS2d 618 (3rd Dept. 1984). Although 
the defendant submits considerable expert medical proof to the contrary, 
the Court views the discrepancies between the medical reports and 
affidavits submitted on behalf of the parties to involve issues of 
credibility for resolution by the jury. 
Vasilatos v. 
Chatertonon, 135 
AD2d 1073, 523 NYS2d 211 
 (3rd Dept. 1987). 
Accordingly, the defendant Lynn M. Hackel's motion for summary 
judgment and dismissal of plaintiff James K. Weir's action pursuant to 
CPLR 53212 on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to reach the 
threshold of a serious physical injury as defined in Insurance Law 55104 
is hereby denied. 
The foregoing constitutes the decision of the Court.
