SEAGRAVE ESTABLISHMENT, INC., 
BARBARA R. KAPNICK, J. : 
Plaintiff 
 Francois Chateau, the tenant of 
residential 
 property 
located at 177 East 
75th Street, Apartment 6AB, New York, 
New York 
(the "demised premises ") commenced this action against 
 defendant- 
landlord 
 Seagrave Establishment, Inc. seeking a temporary, 
preliminary and/or a permanent injunction pursuant to First 
National Stores, Inc. v. Yellowstone 
 ShoDDinq Center, Inc., 21 
N.Y.2d 30 (1968) (first cause of action); a judgment declaring that 
defendant has waived its right to enforce any "no pet" provision 
that may exist in plaintiff's lease for the demised premises 
(second cause of action); a judgment declaring that the notice to 
cure dated June 22, 2001, which alleges that plaintiff is in 
violation of the terms of his lease by harboring a dog in the 
apartment, is defective and a nullity (third cause of action); and 
a judgment awarding plaintiff attorney's fees in an amount to be 
determined by the Court (fourth cause of action). [* 2 ]
Plaintiff now moves for an order pursuant to CPLR §§ 6301 and 
6313: 
(1) staying and tolling the expiration of the cure period set 
forth in the Notice to Cure dated June 22, 2001 pending this 
Court’s determination of plaintiff’s rights under the lease; 
(2) temporarily, preliminarily and/or permanently enjoining 
and restraining defendant, its agents, attorneys, representatives 
and all persons known and unknown acting on its behalf or in 
concert with it, in any manner and any means from: 
(a) terminating or attempting to terminate 
 plaintiff’s lease 
dated October 25, 1995 which was extended by lease renewal 
agreement dated October 9, 2000 and/or tenancy at the demised 
premises; 
(b) commencing or attempting to commence any proceeding or 
action to evict or eject plaintiff from the demises premises; and 
(c) taking any action to interfere in any manner with 
plaintiff‘s possession of the demised premises. 
Defendant cross-moves for an order dismissing this action on 
the ground that plaintiff can obtain full protection of his tenancy 
rights in the context of a summary proceeding in 
the.Civi1 Court of 
the City of New York. 
2 [* 3 ]
The courts of this State have repeatedly held that the "Civil 
Court has jurisdiction of landlord tenant disputes (see CCA 204) 
and when it can decide the dispute, ..., it is desirable that it do 
so (citation omitted) 
 .I1 Post v. 120 East End Avenue, 62 N.Y.2d 19, 
28 (1984). 
"In the instant case, however, Civil Court cannot afford 
'complete relief to plaintiff , which seeks equitable relief 
available only in Supreme Court; the limited injunctive and 
restraining authority of Civil Court does not extend to the matter 
in dispute (see, Civil Court Action § 203 [o] ) . 
I' North Waterside 
RedeveloDment Co. v. Febbraro, 256 A.D.2d 261, 262 (lst Dep't 1998), 
lv. to aDD. dism'd, 93 N.Y.2d 888 (1999). See also, Trump Villaae 
Section 3, Inc. v. Sinrod, 219 A.D.2d 590 
(2nd Dep't 1995). The 
cross-motion to dismiss this action must, therefore, be denied. 
As to plaintiff's motion, this Court notes that defendant's 
own notice to cure alleges that 
"[o]n April 2, 2001 the landlord's 
agents became aware of the fact that [plaintiff was] harboring a 
dog in [his] apartment. " However, it appears that defendant failed 
to commence a summary proceeding or action to enforce the lease 
provision prohibiting the keeping of such household pets within 
three months thereafter, as required pursuant to section 27- 
2009.l(b) of the New York City Administrative Code. See, 
MetroDolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Friedman, 205 A.D.2d 303 (1" 
Dep't 1994); cf., TrumD Villaae Section 3, Inc. v. Sinrod, supra at 
592. 
3 [* 4 ]
Accordingly, plaintiff’s motion is granted and defendant, 
 its 
agents, attorneys, representatives and all persons acting on its 
behalf or in concert with it, are preliminarily enjoined from 
terminating or attempting to terminate plaintiff’s lease and/or 
tenancy, from commencing or attempting to commence any proceeding 
interfere in any manner with plaintiff’s possession of his 
apartment based on the Notice to Cure dated June 22, 2001.
