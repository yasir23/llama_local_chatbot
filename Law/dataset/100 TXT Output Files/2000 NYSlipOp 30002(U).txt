Sopwith  is owned by Lustgarten and Blatt; Algol

The Bank contended, at trial, that defendants owed money as a result of net losses in their
foreign exchange trading accounts. Defendants countered that the trades that resulted in those losses

Trisha is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Lustgarten; Optimum is owned by the Fischbach family, and a
power of attorney has been given to Lustgarten; cprnmon  connections between the individual defendants and
the five defendant companies. The five defendant companies are all owned by Blatt, Lustgarten, and
Fischbach, and their wives, parents, and children. All are residents of Caracas, Venezuela, and alllive in the same apartment house. Four of the five companies share the same mailing address, and
the fifth uses Fischbach ’ s Miami apartment as its mailing address. When the individual defendants
decided to begin foreign exchange trading in 1990, Lustgarten was Fischbach ’ s prospective 3 475.

3Sopwith,  Trisha, and
Hungarian were to obtain the approximately $2.4 million in assets, the likelihood is that the money
would disappear. The Bank asserts defendants are non-resident aliens who have never disclosed the
existence of significant assets in the United States, and that defendants are not generally subject toSopwith,  Trisha, and Hungarian. The Bank claims that if  NY2d 806 (1999).
On May 11, 1999, this Court signed an order to show cause containing a temporary
restraining order preventing defendants from making any attempt to enforce the judgment.
Following a hearing held on September 27, this Court directed that the temporary restraining order
continue in effect until determination of the instant motions.
In moving for the restraining order, the Bank asserts that it is entitled to set off the amounts
it was awarded against Algol, Optimum, and the individual defendants to reduce the amounts the
Bank owes to  Sonwith  Holdings Corn., 93(1” Dept 1999). Cross motions for leave to appeal were
denied by the Court of Appeals on May 4, 1999. Banaue Indosuez v AD2d.  5 19 HoldinPs Corn., 257 Sonwith Bancme  Indosuez

this verdict, the Court entered judgment awarding  $3,13&l 80.90 against Algol and
Optimum, and based upon indemnity provisions, found the individual defendants Lustgarten, Blatt,
and Fischbach personally liable to varying degrees for the obligations of Algol and/or Optimum.
The jury nevertheless found that the Bank converted the funds of were unauthorized. In reaching its verdict, the jury found that none of the trades made by the bank
for defendants were unauthorized, and therefore awarded the Bank

Discussion
It has long been recognized that a set-off is proper only where there is mutuality between the
parties, each of whom owes a sum certain to the other. Sopwith, Trisha, and Hungarian will be
taking steps to enforce the judgment, not render it ineffectual, and that the Bank is precluded from
setting off the judgments against the portion protected by the attorneys ’ lien under Judiciary LawSopwith,  Trisha, and
Hungarian and, accordingly, an injunction against enforcement of the judgment is necessary. TheBank contends a restraining order is necessary to protect it from defendants ’ threat to enforce the
judgment immediately pending entry of a revised form of judgment.
Defendants maintain that the judgment is final and beyond the jurisdiction of this Court to
alter. Although the final paragraph of the judgment recites that the Court shall retain jurisdiction for
the purpose of determining attorneys ’ fees and other costs and disbursements, defendants claim the
Court did not retain jurisdiction for any other purpose. Defendants further assert that a set-off is not
appropriate due to a lack of the requisite mutuality, and that $736,5 14.29
and attorneys ’ fees, costs, and disbursements. The Bank claims that the recovery it will seek forlegal expenses greatly exceeds the portion of the judgment in favor of  $736,5  14.29.
The Bank intends to move to amend the judgment to reflect the net amount of jurisdiction for discovery in aid of execution under CPLR Article 52. The net result of a set-off, the
Bank asserts, is that Algol, Optimum, and the individual defendants are liable to the Bank in the
amount of 
[* 4 ]
Sopwith,  Trisha, and Hungarian from collecting
on the judgment because the Bank is due additional money from Algol and Optimum.
The Court is sympathetic to the Bank’ s concerns. Defendants are non-resident aliens who
have never disclosed the existence of significant assets in the United States. However, the Bank
chose to conduct business in the United States with individuals who reside in Venezuela. It is not
5See Judgment, at 8-9. The jury specifically found that
three of the five companies were entitled to a recovery from the Bank. It would be contrary to the
body of set-off and mutuality case law to prevent Sopwith, Trisha, and
Hungarian approximately $2.4 million from the Bank and the Bank was awarded more than $3.1
million from Algol and Optimum. Although the entities are no doubt related, as evidenced by their
organization and somewhat overlapping owners, the ownership is not identical and the Appellate
Division specifically found that the finding of individual liability was not based upon piercing of thecorporate veil. Indeed, in signing the judgment, this Court struck the three paragraphs ordering andadjudging the three individual defendants personally and individually liable pursuant to the doctrines
of alter ego and piercing the corporate veil. . “‘) (citations omitted).
In the present case, such mutuality is lacking, as the judgment awarded . . . AD2d  746,747 (3d Dept 1976) ( “It is axiomatic that ‘ claims
or demands sought to be set off must not only be mutual to the extent that they are owing by each

(quoting NY2d 253,259 (1992) ( “Under our decisions, debts
and credits are mutual when they are ‘ due to and from the same person  See Matter of Midland Ins. Co., 79 ),More than one century later, this basic principle remains
unchanged. .”.. debts by way of mutual deduction.

at 521. In any event, the Bank still has avenues to pursue its judgment not only from Algol and
Optimum, but also from Lustgarten, Blatt, and Fischbach, who were all found personally liable to
varying degrees in the judgment pursuant to the indemnity agreements.
Moreover, the Bank ’ s request for an order restraining defendants from enforcing the
judgment is contrary to established case law holding that attorneys ’ liens take priority to set-offs.
In fact, New York courts have long held that an attorneys ’ lien is superior to the right of the parties
to a set-off, as a set-off would destroy the judgment to which the lien attaches.  sunra,  257 “ [tlhe
bank could have easily protected itself from the inequities it now claims by properly monitoring the
margin accounts or by obtaining cross collateral agreements. ” Banaue Indosuez, the province of the Court, at this stage of the litigation, to disrupt the jury ’ s finding, especially when
the judgment has been affirmed on appeal. Furthermore, as the Appellate Division stated,

Reply Aff. in Opposition, Exh. B. These agreements provide that Katz, “[i]t has long been held that parties cannot offset judgments so
as to defeat an attorney ’ s lien.“ ).
As for the request by the Bank for costs and attorneys ’ fees, the final paragraph of the June
11 judgment states:
pursuant to the agreement of counsel, (i) taxation of costs and (ii) the claims brought
by BANQUE INDOSUEZ for attorneys ’ fees and other costs and disbursements,pursuant to the provisions of the agreements between the parties, and all discovery,
if any, that may be sought pertaining thereto, shall be and the same hereby are stayed
and deferred pending the final determination of any and all appeals from this
judgment, and the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York,
shall retain jurisdiction of this matter for the purpose of adjudicating said claims of
BANQUE INDOSUEZ and taxing costs.
Judgment at 9-l 0. Accordingly, the parties agreed that the claims for attorneys ’ fees, costs, and
disbursements would be determined following all appeals of the judgment., The parties further
agreed that this Court retains jurisdiction for the purpose of adjudicating such claims.
Because the Appellate Division has affirmed the judgment and the Court of Appeals has
denied leave to appeal, pursuant to the June 11 judgment, this Court may address the claims for the
Bank’ s attorneys’ fees, costs, and disbursements. At this time, however, such action is premature,
as the Bank has yet to submit to the Court a motion or any documentation for such costs.
As for the claim by the Bank that the defendants ’ attorneys’ lien claims have not been
adequately proven, copies of retainer agreements have been provided to the Court. Cty 199 1) (because an attorney ’ s lien comes into existence when complaint is served and is superior
to the lien of any judgment creditor,

Accordingly, it isORDERED that the temporary restraining order signed on May 11, 1999 and continued on& Rodes is appropriate,

documentation fails to adequately explain what the majority of attorneys ’ fees derive from. Instead,
more than $27,000 is attributed to an unpaid prior statement, without further explanation. It beingunclear to the Court at this time that the amount sought by Trachtenberg Sopwith  Holdings Corp., et al., New York County Index No.Sopwith,  Trisha, and Hungarian, the.
