After an extraordinarily long trial, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the 
PLAINTIFF in the approximate sum of $4,250,000.00. The PLAINTIFF has moved for 
post trial relief including a new trial on damages and/or a waiver of the application of 
CPLR article 50-B. 
Let me dispose of the request for a waiver of Article 50-B first. The statute is clear 
that this can only be accomplished with the consent of all parties and the DEFENDANTS 
have not consented. Therefore the court has no pcwer to order a waiver of 50-B. The 
motion for that relief is denied. 
The PLAINTIFF's motion for a new trial is premised on alleged tainted jury 
dehl>erations, inadequacy of the verdict and references allegedly throughout the trial to the 
PLAINTIFF's worker's compe~tion benefits. 
The concern over the refercn~ to worker's compensation benefits was taken care 
ofby a curative charge by this court at the time of the objection by PLAINTIFF's ccunsel. 
The instruction at the time made it clear that any compensation benefits paid for medh:al 
expenses were to be repaid by the PLAINTIFF. In addition nothing contained in the 
extensive affidavits from the jurors indicates in any way that this was coniusing or 
contnl>uted to their deliberations on damages in this 1ctio~.

Decision of the Honorable Peter J. Notaro, J.S.C., 
Dated November 9, 1999. 
Th~ remaining portion of PLA.INTIFF's motion is supported by affidavits from the 
jurors e:tpl ~ing a concern over the adequacy of the verdict. The affidavits indicate that 
one of the j1 · rs related that she had settled a personal injury actiou and had received her 
settlem.CT·t •. a lump sum. The apparent conclusion reached by the jurors was that the 
PLAil\ ~'IFF would receive the verdict in a !ump sum. Having disco,,·ercd that the 
PLAINTIFF would not rect-ive it in a lump sum, subsequent to the rendering of ihei: 
verdict, but instead would receive a portion of the award in an annuity, the jurors arc now 
heard to claim that the verdict they rendered was inadequate and that they would have 
awarded a substantially larger sum. 
The PLAINTIFF contends that the recitation of one jurors experiences constitutes 
an improper outside influence sufficient to warrant the granting of a new trial, relying on 
Fir-.,zibbons v. New York State Univt!rsity Construction Fund, 177 A.D. 2d 1033(4th 
Dept, 1991) which held: 
'1be verdict was tainted by an improper outside influence, viz., one 
juror's communications to the others about the benefits plaintiff would 
receive from workers' compensation. In i11forming the other jurors about the 
workers' compensation system and her experience with it, the juror injected 
"significant extra-record facts" into the deliberation process and thereby 
became an unswom witness to "nonrecord evidence" (see, People v. 
Legister, 15 N.Y .2d 832, 833, 552 N.Y.S.2d 906, 552 N.E.2d 154; A/ford 
v. Sventek, 53 N.Y .2d 743, 745,439 N.Y.S.2d339,421 N.E.2d83 l; People 
v. Brown. 48 N.Y .2d 388, 393, 423 N.Y.S.2d 461, 399 N.E.2d 51). 
Moreover, by persuading the other jurors that plaintiff "was eligi"ble to have 
his medical bills paid and to receive other workers' compensation benefits 
fc; the rest of his life", the juror improperly introduced her own legal notions 
into the case, thereby leading the jurors to depart from the law set forth in the 
court's charge (cf. Maslinsld v. Brunswick Hosp. Center, 118 A.D.2d 834, 
500 N.Y.S.2d 318; .Long v. Payne, 198 A.D. 667, 670-671, 190 N.Y.S. 
803). Plaintiff sufficiently proved prejudice as a result of those 
communications (see. A/ford v. Sventelc, supra). According to the unrefuted

affidavits of two jurors, the jury awarded plaintiff "less for medical bills and 
other items of damages than [itJ would have awarded" absent those 
communications. 
The conduct of the juror in the Fitzgibbons case, informing the other jurors about 
the workers' compensation system and by persuading the other jurors that plaintiff was 
eligible to have his medical bills paid and to receive other workers' compensation benefits 
for the rest of his life, constituted more than a mere recitation of a jurors own experiences 
with the personal injury system. In this case the juror did not injected "significant cxtra­
record facts" into the deliberation process. The other cases cited by PLAINTIFF also 
contain significantly more than a juror bringing relatively common experiences into the 
jurors deliberations. The bringing in of an outside medical dictionary for the purpose of 
ascertaining thei: own definition of malpractice, Maslinski v. Brunswick Hospital Center, 
118 A.D.2d 834 (2ac1 Dept., 1986), an attorney-juror wrongly instructing the jurors on the 
law, 21 Jones st«et Associates v. Keebler-Berma. 177 Misc. 2d 600 (1999), constitutes 
information that went to the heart of the case and created a substantial risk oiprejudice.

I the case. Jurors will not be heard to impeach their own verdict unless there is a 
substantial risk of prejudice to the party moving against the verdict. 
"A general rule in New York is that jurors may not be hC3rd tc impeach 
the verdict of their own jury. This means that they can't, with 
affidavits or testimony or in any other way, adduce anything that would 
tend to overturn the verdict once it's been delivered. The primary 
intent of this rule is to keep sacrosanct the processes and deliberations 
of the jury and to insulate the verdict from later revelations of what 
went on in the jury room." New York Practice, 2nd Edition, David D. 
Siegel, p. 605.

~on of the Honorable Peter J. Notaro, J.S.C., 
Dated November 9, 1999. 
PLAINTIFF would have this court inject itself into the hearts and minds of the jurors and 
review their findings of damages without a substantial showing of juror misconduct. 
Jurors bring into the jwy room their life expcriemnces and share them with the other jurors. 
Barring a showing that there has been an overreaching by a juror or a misdirection of law 
by a juror wi!h sufficient appearance of authoritativeness by that juror, the verdict cannot 
be impeached. There is not sufficient cause here to warrant a hearing requiring the jurors 
to sh.are with the court the heart of their deliberations. 
· The only remaining issue is the motion for a new trial on the sole grounds that the 
verdict is inadaquate. The traditonal standard for a trial court to deal with this motion is 
whether the verdict "shocks the ~onscience" of the cou.~ The traditional standard for trial 
court review has been modified by Prunty v. YMCA of Lockport, Inc., 616 N. Y .S.2d 117, 
206 A.D.2d 91 l(N.Y .A.D. 4 Dept. 1994) which said 
"At least two of the Departments of the Appellate Division have ruled that 
a trial court may overturn a jury's award of.damages in a negligence action 
where it "deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation" 
(CPLR 550l[c]; see, Cochetti v. Gra/ow, 192 A.D.2d 974, 975, 597 
N. Y .S.2d 234 [3d Dept.]; Wendell v. Supermarkets Gen. Corp., 189 A.D.2d 
1063, 592 N.Y.S.2d 895 [3d Dept.]; Shurgan v. Tedesco, 179 A.D.2d 805, 
578 N.Y.S.2d 658 [2d Dept.]; see also, Siegel, Supp. Practice 
Commentaries, McKinney's C'lns.Laws ofN .Y ., Book 7B, CPLR C5501: 10, 
1994 Pocket Pan, at 4-5), and we now adopt the same rule." 
The Appellate Division cautioned , however, that "Although the court should exercise its 
discretion over damage awards sparingly (Shurgan v. Tedesco, supra, at 806, 578 N.Y .S.2d 
658), it is accorded considerable latitude in that regard (see, Staiano v. Crolilc, 51 A.D.2d 
649, 378 N.Y.S.2d 542)." The awards for lost wag~. for medical expenses and for 
household services have a substantial basis in the evidence and do constitute reasonable 
compensation. I am troubled, however, by the award for past and future pain and 
suffering. The DEFENDANT's own Independent Medical Examining doctor, Dr. Lynch,

made it clear that the injuries suffered by the PLAINTIFF were permanent and pervasive. 
His report was so troubling to the defense that, according to Dr. Lynch, the defense 
anempted to persuade Dr. Lynch to modify his findings on several occasions. According 
to Dr. Lynd .• the PLAINTIFF has no likelihood of ever recovering from the trauma. 
However, I cannot conclude that the award ofS 161, 7 65 .00 for past pain and su:Eering and 
the award of S 1.488,255 .00 for future pain and suffering "deviates materially' ..Yom what 
would be adequate c~tion. As a result the PLAINTIFF's motion for a new trial is 
denied. 
This court granted Summary Judgement to the PLAINTIFF against the 
DEFENDANTS Board of Education, Yomac and Pinto. The court further determined that 
indemnification for the Boani of Education from the DEFEND.A1'11S, other than 
McPherson, needed to be resolved at trial. That trial is yet to take place. To that extent, 
any attempt by Y omac to end its continuing liability to the PLAINTIFF and the Board of 
Education (for indemnification) cannot be limited by the tender of its insurance policy. 
I The liability to the PLAINTIFF is not s.·;verable and the CPLR limitations on the 
I PLAINTIFF settling with one of several tortfeasor under these circumstances act as a bar 
to one DE~NDANT attempting what Yomac has suggested. Yomac has exposure 
significantly greater than the tender to the f'LAINTIFF and may have that additional 
expo.rure to the Board of Education and other DEFENDANTS. The motion to pay i."lto 
coun is denied. 
Submit Order accordingly.
